## Algorithm-based development of an instrument to measure self-perceived data literacy

The increasing relevance of competent and critical handling of data in society not only makes it 
possible to record this competence, but also makes the self-perception of this competence increasingly important.
Previous approaches considered this competence primarily against the specific background of individual target
groups, jobs or roles (Cui et al., 2023). In addition, only a few explicitly refer to the general 
population (Cui et al., 2023; Carmi et al., 2020). In view of the various theoretical approaches, 
there is a need for a uniform definition of data literacy in order to create comparability.

Our aim is therefore to derive a holistic definition based on these approaches and to develop a 
questionnaire for self-perception of one's own data literacy. To this end, the decisive factors from previous 
definitions and operationalizations in various disciplines are brought together. Cognitive interviews are 
conducted iteratively to create and refine the items. The items are then selected using algorithm-based
item selection. The facets of data literacy are tested for factorial, discriminant, convergent and congruent
incremental validity in order to promote a differentiated understanding of the construct. 
Construct and criterion validity are tested using correlations and hierarchical regression analyses,
while cross-validation checks the robustness of the instrument.
Based on a cross-sectional online survey, we will examine a representative sample from the general population. 

Limitations result from the cross-sectional design and the heuristic item reduction, which prevent causal 
conclusions and limit predictive validity. The heterogeneous nature of the construct makes the development
of a global instrument and understanding of all participants difficult.
The self-assessment questionnaire shall enable a holistic assessment of perceived competence for further studies, 
for example by comparing self-assessment and actual performance.
