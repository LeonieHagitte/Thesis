## Algorithm-based development of an instrument to measure self-rated data literacy

The increasing importance of competent and critical data handling in society (Carmi et al., 2020) emphasises the necessity to assess and understand one's own data literacy. Previous approaches to data literacy primarily target specific groups and professions, with few including the general population (Cui et al., 2023). Given the diversity of theoretical approaches (Cui et al., 2023), we feel there is an urgent need for a unified definition of data literacy to ensure comparability and holistic assessment.

Objective
Our aim is to derive a comprehensive definition of data literacy based on existing approaches and to develop a questionnaire for self-perceived data literacy, measuring the three core factors of the construct. While drafts for two additional factors are included as preliminary assessments for future studies, they are not the focus of this study. To achieve this, we integrate essential factors from various disciplines via a literature review to develop a theory-driven conceptualisation of constructs. Furthermore, we apply an iterative process for item creation and refinement, followed by the selection of the best items for a final scale.
We arrived at five core facets that are also very prominent in the most definitions in the literature (Cui et al., 2023). We further divided them into “consumer” facets (Comprehension,Evaluation & Integration), that are relevant for nearly every person in society and “producer” facets (Communication & Statistics), that are mainly relevant for people, actively working with data.
