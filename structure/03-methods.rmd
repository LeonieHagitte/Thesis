## Sample

The sample for this study comprised XXX participants (M=, SD=). Within the sample, XXX% identified as female, XXX% as male, and xxx% did not identify with binary gender categories. All participants were aged 18 and above. Regarding education, all participants exhibited a [insert educational level- specifying the range or types of educational levels observed in the sample]. Among the participants, n= reported higher knowledge on items x, x, x, leading to their selection for an additional set of items as a preliminary survey for factors four and five.
The study encompassed every sector within the occupational classification (Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit, 2020), ensuring comprehensive representation. Conducted in German, the participation in the study was entirely voluntary, with no external incentives provided. The recruitment of participants was carried out through a combination of personal and professional networks, along with outreach on various online social media platforms.

Our study sample serves as a focal point for comparison against the demographic landscape of the general public in Germany. In 2022, the mean age of the German population was 44.6 years, with 45,457,000 individuals engaged in employment. Educational backgrounds varied (XXX), and for gender distribution, the split was nearly 50/50 (41,616,473 males and 42,816,197 females) according to the Statistisches Bundesamt (source: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Bevoelkerungsstand/Tabellen/liste-zensus-geschlecht-staatsangehoerigkeit.html#651186).

Analyzing our sample against these benchmarks provides a comprehensive understanding of any distinctions or parallels in age, employment, education, and gender. This comparison enhances the applicability of our findings to the broader German population.
