# Methods

## 1. Stage One: Conceptualization and Item Pool Generation 
   - Review relevant literature to develop a theory-driven conceptualization of constructs.
   - Ensure diversity in the interviews regarding age and occupation.
   - Include as many members of target group in the item creation process as possible.
   - Integrate theory and interview results to generate an initial item pool.
   - Present original items to a small group for piloting - item difficulty/ fairness etc.
   - Exclude items as necessary, resulting in a refined item pool.

## 2. Stage Two: Item Selection and Construct Validity
   - Conduct a quantitative survey including the original item pool, demographics, and validation measures.
   - Utilize automated item selection procedures to reduce the item pool.
   - Utilize an algorithm to select items from the original item pool and develop the final version of the scale.
   - Use an algorithm implemented in the R package "stuart" with predefined datasets split into training and test datasets.
   - Evaluate solutions against an objective function consisting of model fit criteria and composite reliability.
   - Evaluate model fit using standard recommendations proposed by Hu and Bentler (1999), including $\chi^2$ significance testing   and fit indices.
   - ez cutoffs. ; discussing dynamic fit indices
   - Hypothesize relationships between the newly created measure and related constructs.
   - Use distinct but conceptually similar instruments for validation purposes.
   - Cross-validate findings using a split-sample approach?
   - Evaluate solutions against an objective function consisting of model fit criteria and composite reliability.
   - Validate findings using k-fold cross-validation with the dataset?
   - Conduct confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with the R package "lavaan."

## 3. Stage Three: External and Construct Validity Testing 
   - Perform bivariate correlational analyses with relevant related constructs to establish external validity.
   - Investigate construct validity through multiple regression analysis, controlling for other variables.
   - Discuss specific hypotheses regarding associations between the measure and related constructs.


## Sample

The sample for this study comprised XXX participants (M=, SD=). Within the sample, XXX% identified as female, XXX% as male, and xxx% did not identify with binary gender categories. All participants were aged 18 and above. Regarding education, all participants exhibited a [insert educational level- specifying the range or types of educational levels observed in the sample]. Among the participants, n= reported higher knowledge on items x, x, x, leading to their selection for an additional set of items as a preliminary survey for factors four and five.
The study encompassed every sector within the occupational classification (Bundesagentur für Arbeit, 2020), ensuring comprehensive representation. Conducted in German, the participation in the study was entirely voluntary, with no external incentives provided. The recruitment of participants was carried out through a combination of personal and professional networks, along with outreach on various online social media platforms.

Our study sample serves as a focal point for comparison against the demographic landscape of the general public in Germany. In 2022, the mean age of the German population was 44.6 years, with 45,457,000 individuals engaged in employment. Educational backgrounds varied (XXX), and for gender distribution, the split was nearly 50/50 (41,616,473 males and 42,816,197 females) according to the Statistisches Bundesamt (source: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Bevoelkerungsstand/Tabellen/liste-zensus-geschlecht-staatsangehoerigkeit.html#651186).

Analyzing our sample against these benchmarks provides a comprehensive understanding of any distinctions or parallels in age, employment, education, and gender. This comparison enhances the applicability of our findings to the broader German population.

## Preregistration

## Instruments

## Measuring Moral Attentiveness
To assess moral attentiveness, we employed the perceptual moral attentiveness scale derived from the German Moral Attentiveness Scale by Pohling et al.(2014); adapted from Reynolds, 2008). This subscale comprises four items, including statements such as "I am regularly confronted with decisions that have significant ethical consequences." The scale comprises a seven-point Likert-type scale with fully labeled options, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).

## Measuring Openness towards technology

ICT-SC was measured, using the ICT-SC25g. The ICT-SC25 is a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess ICT self-concept (ICT-SC) on both a general scale (items 1-5) and a domain-specific scale (items 6-25). Responses to items are provided on a six-point Likert-type scale with fully labeled options, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6). The questionnaire has undergone validation in German (ICT-SC25g). Its applicability extends across the adult population, spanning ages 18 to 69, and diverse contexts including work, private life, and education. 

## Item Creation

After drafting a set of items, those items were being reviewed in cognitive interviews in an iterative manner. The idea was to go through the items with different people and ask them if the items are comprehensive, whether it is clear to them what is being asked with the items and what everyone associates with the item and so on. After every interview, the remarks made by the Person interviewed get worked into the items and then the reworked item set is presented in the next interview and so on.
