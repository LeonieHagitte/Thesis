\section*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

The increasing relevance of competent and critical handling of data in
society not only makes it possible to record this competence, but also
makes self-perception with regard to this competence increasingly clear.
Previous approaches consider this competence primarily against the
specific background of individual target groups, jobs or roles
(\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{Cui et al., 2023}). In addition, only a few
explicitly refer to the general population
(\citeproc{ref-Carmi2020}{Carmi et al., 2020};
\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{Cui et al., 2023}). In view of the various
theoretical approaches, there is a need for a uniform definition of data
literacy in order to create comparability. Our aim is therefore to
derive a holistic definition based on these approaches and to develop a
questionnaire for self-perception of one's own data literacy. To this
end, the decisive factors for the construct from previous definitions
and operationalizations in various disciplines are brought together.
Cognitive interviews are conducted iteratively to create and refine the
items. The items are then selected using algorithm-based item selection.
The facets of data literacy are comprehensively tested for factorial,
discriminant, convergent and congruent incremental validity in order to
promote a differentiated understanding of the construct. Construct and
criterion validity are tested using correlations and hierarchical
regression analyses, while cross-validation checks the robustness of the
instrument. Based on a cross-sectional online questionnaire study, we
first examine a representative sample of people from the general
population. Limitations arise from the cross-sectional design and the
heuristic item reduction, which limit predictions of predictive
validity. The heterogeneous nature of the construct makes global
instrument development and understanding of all participants difficult.
The self-assessment questionnaire promotes a holistic assessment of
competence and its perception for further research, for example by
comparing self-assessment and actual performance.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The relevance of data literacy in today's society becomes evident as it
serves as a potent tool in navigating the complex data-driven
environment. In a world characterized by information overload and rapid
technological advancements, individuals equipped with strong data
literacy skills can discern patterns, critically evaluate information,
and make informed decisions

The exploration of citizens' interaction with media and the cultivation
of their agency has traditionally centered around concepts such as
written literacy, media literacy, information literacy, and digital
literacy. In more recent discussions, Data Literacy has been approaching
relevance among discussed competencies regarding what is necessary for
agency in the current society (\citeproc{ref-Carmi2020}{Carmi et al.,
2020}). Deficiency in data literacy not only exposes individuals to
various risks and harms on personal, social, physical, and financial
levels but also constrains their capacity to actively engage as informed
citizens within an evolving, data-driven society
(\citeproc{ref-Carmi2020}{Carmi et al., 2020}). Thus, Data Literacy is a
competency that is becoming increasingly important to everyone. And
research has acknowledged this in recent years, as more and more
research is being done in that direction (\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{Cui et
al., 2023}).

\section{Background}\label{background}

Data Literacy involves the ability to effectively collect, manage,
evaluate, and apply data in a critical manner. According to Wolff et al.
(\citeproc{ref-wolff2016}{2016}), it means being able to ask and answer
everyday questions using both small and large datasets while considering
ethical aspects. This includes skills such as selecting, cleaning,
analyzing, visualizing, criticizing, and interpreting data, as well as
communicating insights from data and using data for various purposes.
(\citeproc{ref-frank2016}{Frank, 2016}) distinguish between cognitive
skills, like data collection and analysis, and social skills, which
involve trusting data while maintaining skepticism.
(\citeproc{ref-prado2013}{Calzada Prado \& Marzal, 2013}) outline five
dimensions of Data Literacy: understanding data, acquiring data,
interpreting and evaluating data, managing data, and using data.
Understanding data includes knowing their types, roles, and
significance, while acquiring data involves evaluating and selecting
sources. Interpreting and evaluating data encompass understanding
different presentation methods and data interpretation. Using data
involves preparation, analysis, communication, and ethical
considerations. Managing data includes storage, management, and reuse.
This highlights one prominent feature of Data Literacy - It is a
heterogeneous concept. Every subject or profession seems to hold their
own definition or framework of Data Literacy (\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{Cui
et al., 2023}). While that most certainly is good for assessing specific
skills (e.g.~in an Recruitment test), it limits the generalisability and
comparability of Data Literacy across individuals with different
background. It furthermore limits the accuracy of communication about
the topic as two people with different background might hold different
definitions on Data Literacy. In the study from
(\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{Cui et al., 2023}) it also becomes apparent,
that one group seems to be underrepresented in the research on Data
Literacy: citizens or the general public. While there seem to be several
definitions of Data literacy for citizens
(\citeproc{ref-wolff2016}{Wolff et al., 2016}), most studies focus on
other groups of people. This is the case although, the general public is
forming the largest group by far, compared to professions like
researchers, librarians, students or education provider
(\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{Cui et al., 2023}). Thus, one might arrive at
the question, why that ist? When taking a closer look into the concept
and its comprising factors,it becomes clear that many of those factors
tend to speak to professionals rather than laypeople. In their Framework
(\citeproc{ref-schuxfcller2020}{schüller, 2020}) highlight the different
roles in Data Literacy: Some of the facets or skills regard
``data-consumption'', whereas the most are skills ``data-producers''
would have. This is also reflected when taking a look into related
concepts. The definition proposed by Wolff et al.
(\citeproc{ref-wolff2016}{2016}) suggests that data literacy shares some
common competencies with statistical and information literacies.\\
Information literacy, often studied in library sciences, overlaps with
data literacy in terms of accessing, critically evaluating, and using
data sources (\citeproc{ref-prado2013}{Calzada Prado \& Marzal, 2013};
\citeproc{ref-shields2005}{Shields, 2005}), Wolff et al.
(\citeproc{ref-wolff2016}{2016}) also emphasize the importance of the
data inquiry process, starting from identifying problems, designing
studies, acquiring data, conducting analysis, to drawing data-based
conclusions. In comparison, Gould (\citeproc{ref-gould2017}{2017})
argued that data literacy is essentially the same as statistical
literacy but with additional competencies needed due to the increasing
importance of data. These added competencies include understanding who
collects the data, how and why data is collected, and understanding data
privacy and ownership (\citeproc{ref-gould2017}{Gould, 2017}). However,
while statistical literacy focuses on quantitative data and basic
statistics, data literacy extends to the ability to understand, access,
evaluate, and use arguments and decision-making based on both
quantitative and qualitative data (\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{Cui et al.,
2023}).

\subsection{Data and Information}\label{data-and-information}

With the closeness of those topics, it is worth while to take a look
into the terminology, before delving deeper into the topic. When
speaking of Data Literacy, one naturally has to think about what data
is. What is information, how are they different to each other and what
extents do they share? And what role does the process of interpretation
play? Does one interpret data to make sense of it? And if so, does that
mean that data is entropy while information stands in opposition to it?
The concepts of data and information are foundational in various fields,
yet their precise definitions and relationships are often subject to
interpretation. According to Shannon's seminal work on information
theory (\citeproc{ref-shannon1948}{Shannon, 1948}), data can be
understood as raw, unprocessed symbols or observations, devoid of
inherent meaning. It is through a process of interpretation and
organization that data transforms into information, as elucidated by
Bates (\citeproc{ref-bates2005}{2005}). Bates emphasizes that
information emerges when data is structured and presented in a way that
is comprehensible and relevant to a particular context or purpose.

Entropy, a concept borrowed from thermodynamics and applied in
information theory, plays a crucial role in understanding the
relationship between data and information. In his landmark paper,
Shannon (\citeproc{ref-shannon1948}{1948}) defines entropy as a measure
of uncertainty or disorder in a system. In the realm of information
theory, entropy is often associated with the amount of unpredictability
or randomness in a set of data. However, it's essential to note that
entropy can also be viewed as a measure of information content within a
system. This perspective is articulated by Brillouin
(\citeproc{ref-brillouin1953}{1953}), who suggests that low entropy
corresponds to a high concentration of meaningful information.
Similarly, the work of Jaynes (\citeproc{ref-jaynes1957}{1957})
highlights the connection between entropy and information, proposing
that information can be quantified in terms of the reduction of
uncertainty or entropy in a system. Thus, we can refine our
understanding of the relationship between data, entropy, and
information. While data serves as the raw material from which
information is derived, it's the reduction of entropy through
organization and interpretation that gives rise to meaningful
information. Thus, rather than viewing data as synonymous with entropy
or information, it's more accurate to consider information as emerging
from the structured representation of data, leading to a deeper
understanding of the underlying phenomena.

The framework of (\citeproc{ref-schuxfcller2020}{schüller, 2020}) shows
that citizens are mainly covering roles where they consume data/ data
products or informations. Thus, they are most likely to find tasks or
items regarding the producing facets like providing or exploiting data
more difficult to answer. This would systematically impair the fairness
of tests and questionnaires regarding Data Literacy. Kubinger \& Proyer
(\citeproc{ref-kubinger2005}{2005}) define fairness as the condition
where test measurements or values do not discriminate against specific
groups of people who are relevant to the test. In the case of Data
Literacy it is to be expected, that the item-difficulties in the
producing factors would not be evenly distributed. As you cant just
leave any factors out of the construct, in order to create a concept
that is fair, it would be neccessary to find a way to have the same
factors in the concept with the same distribution of difficulty for all
groups of participants.

\subsection{Conceptual Integration}\label{conceptual-integration}

Thus, via conceptual integration we tried to find common grounds of the
existing theories and studies. By synthesizing heterogeneous definitions
and perspectives (as e.g.~highlighted in the literature review from Cui
et al. (\citeproc{ref-Cui2023}{2023})) into cohesive, unified
representations and selectively incorporating relevant features while
establishing cross-disciplinary connections. With questions in mind like
``What factors and facets do most definitions share?'', ``What are
specifics to certain definitions, addressed to special professions?'',
we arrived at the following structure of the concept:\\
Data literacy is the ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply
data effectively. It involves asking and answering real-world questions
from datasets while considering ethical use. Core skills include
selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, presenting, critiquing, and
interpreting data, information and their sources. We arrived at five
core facets that are also very prominent in the most definitions in the
literature (Cui et al., 2023). We further divided them into ``consumer''
facets (Comprehension,Evaluation \& Integration), that are relevant for
nearly every person in society, from citizens up. And ``producer''
facets (Communication \& Statistics), that are mainly relevant for
people, actively working with data.

\subsubsection{Comprehension}\label{comprehension}

This factor encompasses skills related to understanding and critically
evaluating data and information. It involves the ability to comprehend
various forms of data presentation, detect inconsistencies, interpret
data comprehensively, and identify logical fallacies. Individuals with
high scores on this factor demonstrate a strong aptitude for processing
and making sense of complex information across different formats,
enabling them to draw accurate conclusions and insights.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}

This factor involves skills related to critically evaluating information
sources and discerning between facts and opinions. It encompasses the
ability to assess the credibility and reliability of information,
considering factors such as the reputation of the source and the context
in which the information was presented. Individuals scoring high on this
factor demonstrate a keen awareness of potential biases or vested
interests in information sources.

\subsubsection{Integration}\label{integration}

This factor relates to the ability to integrate data-driven insights
into one's worldview and values. It involves actively seeking
comprehensive understanding of various topics, engaging with diverse
perspectives, and consciously incorporating data-driven insights.
Individuals high in this factor adapt their opinions based on new data,
prefer evidence-based information, and ensure their values align with
reliable data. They engage with information and perspectives that
challenge their existing views, showing a willingness to reassess their
opinions and positions based on new data.

\subsubsection{Communication}\label{communication}

This factor revolves around the skill to effectively communicate and
present data through various means, including visual formats, verbal
explanations, and written descriptions. It requires translating complex
data into clear and impactful formats, ensuring comprehension by varied
audiences. Proficiency in data communication is essential for
facilitating understanding, aiding informed decision-making, and
prompting action based on data-driven insights. This proficiency
includes the ability to translate data into simple visualizations,
present findings confidently, and articulate complex information
effectively in written and visual as well as verbal formats. It involves
adeptly summarizing extensive datasets, engaging in professional
discussions, and using advanced visual elements to convey specialized
results to target audiences.

\subsubsection{Statistics}\label{statistics}

This factor covers skills related to managing and analyzing data
effectively. It involves proficiency in organizing and analyzing data
using software tools, conducting statistical analyses, and understanding
research methodologies. It includes skills such as organizing and
managing data using software tools, conducting interviews or surveys for
data collection, performing basic statistical analysis and recognizing
trends in graphical representations. Individuals scoring high on this
factor exhibit competence in statistical methods, enabling them to
effectively analyze data and interpret findings.

\subsection{Delineation from other concepts - The nomological
net}\label{delineation-from-other-concepts---the-nomological-net}

In line with the framework of schüller
(\citeproc{ref-schuxfcller2020}{2020}) the factors Data Comprehension
and Interpretation, Contextualize and Evaluate Data and Data-Informed
Worldview are representing the application areas for ``consumers''. So
they are relevant for all people in scociety, whereas the other factors,
those speaking to people who are considered ``producers'', are only
common for smaller groups of people or certain professions.\\
This structure encompasses certain characteristics and behaviors from
critical thinking, media competency, technology competency, statistical
Literacy as well as from information literacy.

\subsubsection{Statistical Literacy}\label{statistical-literacy}

Statistical literacy, as defined by Gal (\citeproc{ref-Gal2002}{2002}),
encompasses five knowledge dimensions: literacy skills, statistical
knowledge, mathematical knowledge, contextual knowledge, and critical
reflection skills, along with two dispositional dimensions: beliefs and
attitudes, and a critical mindset. It involves understanding written,
spoken, or graphical information, knowing why data are needed, grasping
basic statistical concepts, understanding probability, and drawing
statistical inferences. It also includes basic mathematical operations,
interpreting information within a context, and critically questioning
the validity of information, particularly in media. Statistical literacy
requires a critical attitude and the perception of oneself as competent
in statistical reasoning.

\subsubsection{Information Literacy}\label{information-literacy}

Information literacy is the ability to recognize when information is
needed and to effectively locate, evaluate, and use that information
(American Library Association (2000). Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education.
\url{http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency} ).
It empowers individuals to determine the extent of information needed,
access it efficiently, critically evaluate information and their
sources, incorporate information into their knowledge base, and use it
effectively for specific purposes. Additionally, information literacy
involves understanding the legal, economic, and social aspects of
information use and ensuring ethical and legal access and use of
information. Furthermore, Information literacy is not static; it
involves a commitment to lifelong learning and adaptation to evolving
information technologies and practices. This definition already
highlights the closeness of Information literacy to Data Literacy.
Another possible way to describe it is suggested by Johnson and Webber
(2003): ``Information literacy is the adoption of appropriate
information behaviour to obtain,through whatever channel or medium,
information well fitted to information needs,together with critical
awareness of the importance of wise and ethical use of information in
society.'' (Johnston \& Webber, 2003, p.336)

\subsubsection{Critical Thinking}\label{critical-thinking}

The conceptualization of Critical Thinking (CrT) has evolved along three
main branches: philosophical, psychological, and educational
(\citeproc{ref-rear2019}{Rear, 2019}). In the philosophical view, which
centers on the mental process of thought, a critical thinker is someone
adept at logically evaluating and questioning both the assumptions of
others and their own. On the psychological front, which delves into the
processes driving action, a critical thinker possesses a combination of
skills enabling them to assess a situation and determine the most
appropriate course of action. The educational approach aligns more
closely with the psychological perspective, relying on frameworks and
learning activities tailored to enhance students' CrT skills and
subsequently assess their proficiency in these skills
(\citeproc{ref-payan2022}{Payan Carreira et al., 2022}).

\subsubsection{Information and Communication Technology
Competency}\label{information-and-communication-technology-competency}

Information and Communication Technology Competency includes general and
domain-specific ICT competencies, including communication, processing
and storing, content generation, safe application, and problem-solving
skills.

Our definition incorporates statistical literacy by emphasizing data
interpretation, analysis, and understanding different types of data
representations, such as graphs and tables (Data Handling and Analysis).
It includes elements of information literacy by focusing on evaluating
the credibility of data sources, considering factors like reputation and
biases, which are similar to assessing the quality of information
sources (Contextualize and Evaluate Data). Both statistical and
information literacy involve using data and information to make informed
decisions. Data literacy emphasizes integrating data-driven insights
into ones opinions and values, that then later on influence
decision-making processes, aligning with the goals of statistical and
information literacy. The factor ``Data Comprehension and
Interpretation'' encompasses behaviors and skills associated with
critical thinking, such as the capacity to identify weaknesses in one's
reasoning or to actively shape discourse and, consequently, the public
dissemination of information. The factor ``Contextualize and Evaluate
Data'', as well as the ``Statistics'' factor, encompass behaviors and
skills related to technology competency. This includes abilities such as
navigating and critically evaluating online sources and platforms, using
information and communication technology, as well as utilizing
statistical software, among others. The ``consumer'' factors are also
closely related to media literacy, which focuses on skills related to
critically analyzing and interpreting various media formats, including
text, images, and videos, for understanding and engaging with media
content.

In contrast, statistical literacy often focuses more narrowly on
statistical concepts and methods, such as probability, sampling, and
hypothesis testing. This definition encompasses a broader range of
skills beyond statistical concepts, such as data visualization, software
usage, and understanding data collection methods. While statistical
literacy often involves analyzing existing data, this definition also
encompasses skills related to producing and manipulating data. This
includes tasks such as creating visualizations and using software tools.
This aspect goes beyond traditional statistical literacy and aligns more
closely with data literacy. While information literacy involves
assessing the quality of information sources, this definition places a
particular emphasis on assessing data quality, considering factors like
sample size, biases, and data context. This aspect extends beyond
traditional information literacy and is more specific to data literacy.
To contrast data literacy from technology competency, it is to be
highlighted, that data literacy involves proficiency in using
technology, but thereby focuses specifically on understanding and
working with data. Technology competency encompasses a broader set of
digital skills that extend beyond those relevant for data literacy.

\subsection{Discrimminant Constructs}\label{discrimminant-constructs}

\subsubsection{Need for Cognition}\label{need-for-cognition}

The personality trait known as Need for Cognition (NFC) originated in
social psychology during the 1940s and 1950s, the concept of NFC,
representing an inclination for joyful thinking, is evident in the works
of Maslow (\citeproc{ref-maslow1943}{1943}), Murphy
(\citeproc{ref-murphy1947}{1947}), Asch (\citeproc{ref-asch1952}{1952}),
and Sarnoff \& Katz (\citeproc{ref-sarnoff1954}{1954}). The
conceptualization of NFC underwent refinement in the mid-1950s through
experimental investigations by Cohen and colleagues
(\citeproc{ref-cohen1955}{Cohen et al., 1955}). They defined NFC as ``a
need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways. It
is a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world''
(\citeproc{ref-cohen1955}{Cohen et al., 1955, p. 291}). The concept
captures individual variations in the engagement and enjoyment of
thinking tasks (\citeproc{ref-bless1994}{Bless et al., 1994}).

\subsubsection{Opennes to new experiences
(B5)}\label{opennes-to-new-experiences-b5}

\subsection{Aim of the Study}\label{aim-of-the-study}

My aim was to derive a comprehensive definition of data literacy based
on existing approaches and to develop a questionnaire for self-perceived
data literacy, measuring the three core factors of the construct. While
drafts for two additional factors are included as preliminary
assessments for future studies, they are not the focus of this study.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{3. Stage Three: External and Construct Validity
Testing}\label{stage-three-external-and-construct-validity-testing}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Perform bivariate correlation analyses with relevant related
  constructs to establish external validity.
\item
  Investigate construct validity through multiple regression analysis,
  controlling for other variables.
\item
  Discuss specific hypotheses regarding associations between the measure
  and related constructs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Item Creation}\label{item-creation}

A literature review was done to create items and then ten cognitive
interviews were held to refine those potential items. The interviews
were administered iteratively to refine the items every time a bit more.
We will treat the first 25 participants like a pilot, to check for
potential problems in the survey.

\subsection{Rationale for Measurement
Model}\label{rationale-for-measurement-model}

One decision that needs to be done by the researcher before the item
selection with `stuart', is the design of the measurement model, or how
many items per factor the final scal should have. This scale will be
created as parsimonious as possible, while ensuring that there is a real
model fit to be estimated. So the dicision in this case was of
statistical nature, while with three items per factor, the model would
have been just identified, four items per factor is the most
parsimoneous choice, where there is already a real model fit, that can
be assessed in the end.

\subsection{Sample}\label{sample}

The participants are recruited on several online social media platforms.
The participation is voluntary. We conducted a-priori power analysis to
determine the necessary sample size for the structural equation
modelling. We used the `semPower' package in R (Moshagen \& Bader, 2023)
and also took a look into studies with similar goals and methods. The
power analysis gave an analytical estimate for N=645, and a simulated
estimate N=613, for the respective measurement model. In the literature
sample sizes of N=500 up to N=1000 could be found (Algner \& Lorenz,
2022; Remmert et al.,2022; Schneider et al.,2024). So the optimal sample
size, we are aiming at, lies somewhere between those numbers.

Participants have to be of legal age, to be included in the study.
Furthermore, attention check questions are included (three instructed
response items and one seriousness check item, at the end) within the
survey to assess participants' attentiveness. Participants who fail to
correctly answer two out of the four attention check questions will be
excluded from the analysis.

The sample for this study comprised XXX participants (M=, SD=). Within
the sample, XXX\% identified as female, XXX\% as male, and xxx\% did not
identify with binary gender categories. All participants were aged 18
and above. Regarding education, all participants exhibited a {[}insert
educational level- specifying the range or types of educational levels
observed in the sample{]}. Among the participants, n= reported higher
knowledge on items x, x, x, leading to their selection for an additional
set of items as a preliminary survey for factors four and five. The
study encompassed every sector within the occupational classification
(Bundesagentur für Arbeit, 2020), ensuring comprehensive representation.
Conducted in German, the participation in the study was entirely
voluntary, with no external incentives provided. The recruitment of
participants was carried out through a combination of personal and
professional networks, along with outreach on various online social
media platforms.

Our study sample serves as a focal point for comparison against the
demographic landscape of the general public in Germany. In 2022, the
mean age of the German population was 44.6 years, with 45,457,000
individuals engaged in employment. Educational backgrounds varied (XXX),
and for gender distribution, the split was nearly 50/50 (41,616,473
males and 42,816,197 females) according to the Statistisches Bundesamt
(source:

\subsubsection{Preregistration}\label{preregistration}

The study was preregistered at Zenodo
(\url{DOI:10.5281/zenodo.11196495}).

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

A cross-sectional online survey is used to examine a representative
sample from the general population. Participants complete the
Self-perceived Data Literacy Scale along with demographic questions and
additional validation measures. Survey questions of each measurement are
randomised for each participant to minimise order effects and response
biases. To shorten the overall length of the assessment the questions in
each factor of the data literacy questionnaire are randomly selected for
each participant. That way each participant only answers half of the
possible items, the other half are planned missings.

\subsection{Instruments}\label{instruments}

\subsubsection{Measuring Data Literacy}\label{measuring-data-literacy}

Measure details: On Data Literacy the participants will be asked to
answer 71 items. Each participant will answer 38 items of the 71, that
are randomly selected. To answer the items, respondents indicate their
agreement on a five-point Likert scale (1 = ``strongly disagree'', 2 =
``somewhat disagree'', 3 = ``neither agree nor disagree'', 4 =
``somewhat agree'', 5 = ``strongly agree'') with a ``don't know''
option.

\subsubsection{Measuring Self-Efficacy to Information
Behavior}\label{measuring-self-efficacy-to-information-behavior}

Measure details: The SWE-IV-16 (Behm, 2018) assesses the self-efficacy
beliefs of adolescents and adults in their ability to engage in
information behaviour. This questionnaire measures the process model of
information-related problem-solving (Brand-Gruwel et al., 2009). It
consists of 16 statements addressing self-assessed abilities in
searching for and evaluating information, as well as managing
information searches effectively. Each statement begins with ``When I
search for information on a topic or a specific question\ldots{}'' and
respondents indicate their agreement on a five-point Likert scale (1 =
``strongly disagree'', 2 = ``somewhat disagree'', 3 = ``neither agree
nor disagree'', 4 = ``somewhat agree'', 5 = ``strongly agree''). Index
and scoring criteria: The total scale value is computed as the
arithmetic mean of the items, which may be inverted if necessary.
Calculation of the total value requires valid responses to at least 12
of the 16 items.

\subsubsection{Measuring Need for
Cognition}\label{measuring-need-for-cognition}

Measure details: The NFC-K (Beißert et al., 2015) is a tool used to
assess the NFC through four items, which represent two facets:
``engagement'' and ``joy''. The NFC-K is measured with a seven-point
response scale, ranging from ``strongly disagree'' (1) to ``strongly
agree'' (7), with a ``neither'' option in the middle. The German version
of the scale is adapted from the original English scale by Cacioppo and
Petty (1982) and translated by Bless et al.~(1994). Index and scoring
criteria: To determine an individual's NFC score, a mean value (scale
value) is computed from the four raw score points of the responses. The
resulting mean values range between 1 and 7.

\subsubsection{Measuring Self-Perceived ICT
Competency}\label{measuring-self-perceived-ict-competency}

Measure details: To assess self-perceived competence in using
information and communication technology (ICT), the five general items
of the ICT-SC25 (Schauffel et al., 2021) will be used. The ICT-SC25 is a
scale consisting of 25 items designed to assess self-perceived
competence in using information and communication technology. It is
available in both German (ICT-SC25g) and English (ICT-SC25e). The scale
measures general and domain-specific ICT competence, including
communication, processing and storing, content generation, safe
application, and problem-solving skills. Items are measured using a
six-point fully-labeled Likert-type rating scale ranging from strongly
disagree (1) to strongly agree (6). Index and scoring criteria:
Researchers can choose to utilise either the entire scale or individual
subscales based on their specific research objectives. The ICT-SC25g/e
is applicable for both manifest and latent analysis. Manifest scale
scores for the ICT- SC25g/e are calculated separately for each subscale
by computing the unweighted mean score of the items within each subscale
(Schauffel et al., 2021).

\subsubsection{Measuring Openness and
Conscientiousness}\label{measuring-openness-and-conscientiousness}

Measure details: The BFI-10 (Rammstedt et al., 2014) will be used to
assess personality based on the five-factor model. Only the items on
openness and conscientiousness were assessed. The items are answered on
a five-point rating scale from ``strongly disagree'' (1) to ``strongly
agree'' (5). Index and scoring criteria: To measure the respondent's
individual traits on the five personality dimensions, the responses to
the two items for each dimension are averaged. First, the negatively
worded item is recoded (items 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7), then the mean value is
calculated for each dimension from both the recoded and non- recoded
items. The values for the five dimensions range from 1 to 5 (see
Rammstedt, 2007 for reference values)

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}

Algorithm-based item selection is used to choose the most relevant
items, reducing the item pool. Unlike classical approaches that consider
items based on their individual merits, heuristic item selection
algorithms aim to enhance the psychometric properties of a set of items
within predetermined constraints (Schultze, 2017). The sample is split
into training and test datasets to evaluate solutions against an
objective function consisting of model fit criteria and composite
reliability. In automated item selection, items can be chosen as sets
that meet specific criteria. Those criteria will be defined in the
objective function in `stuart' (Schultze, 2020). I want to optimize the
final model for model-fit and reliability (RMSEA, SRMR, CFI \& McDonalds
ω) as well as variability in the difficulty of items.

Relationships between the newly created measure and related constructs
are hypothesised. Construct validity is evaluated through confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) and correlation analyses with related constructs.
Crossvalidation and measurement invariance tests are also conducted. I
expect the final questionnaire to correlate moderately up to highly
positive with the SWE-IV-16 (Behm, 2018), measuring peoples ability to
engage in information behaviour. I expect a moderate, positive
correlation of the final scale with the five general items of the
ICT-SC25 (Schauffel et al., 2021). I expect a small positive correlation
with the NFC-K (Beißert et al., 2015), assessing the Need for Cognition
(NFC). I also expect small positive correlations with openness and
conscientiousness of the BFI-10 (Rammstedt et al., 2014). The provided
sample will be divided into subsets using the `holdout' function in
`stuart'. The specified item-selection procedure will be then applied to
the training dataset first. It will then be tested on the testing
dataset. Validation will be conducted using the `crossvalidate' and/or
the `kfold' function in `stuart' to assess the invariance of the
measurement models between the training and validation datasets.
Invariance levels will be measured with the `max.invariance' function.
Invariance will be necessary to claim that the scale validation has
worked.\\
The final item selection will be determined by the highest value on the
objective function in the multiple-group SEM, while ensuring
`max.invariance' between the training and validation data, as well as in
a possible k-fold crossvalidation.

\item

\item
  heterogeneity of construct
\end{itemize}

The heterogeneous nature of the construct complicates global instrument
development and understanding across all participants. The measure is
designed for citizens, potentially limiting discrimination at higher
item difficulties or among more literate participants, a direction we
aim to improve in future studies.

Noteworthy is the inherent approximate, rather than deterministic,
nature of metaheuristics (Schultze \& Lorenz ,2023; Blum and Roli,
2003).
