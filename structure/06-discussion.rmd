# Discussion
- what to optimize the scale for?
- dynamic fit indices
- factors 4 and 5
    - adaptive testing/ IRT
        - dimensionality assumption and computationally intense
    - CART - tree based adaptive testing (classification trees) always binary split
        - gini index to identify the cut off 
        - POMP method - for differing number of answer formats
- residuals correlates 
- heterogeneity of construct
