# Discussion

## Summarising the results

## What does it all mean / "Why?"

- Start with the research question
  - Maybe then towards the hypotheses
- connecting findings to the related theories
- very related/ current literature first, than broader is possible
- When discussind the why - be careful, because i didnt test that

## Limitations

- psych science - authors guide to generelizability
- attempts to control for limitating factors
- dont include to general/ broad critiques, but special one for my own study

## Future directions

########################################

- what to optimize the scale for?
- dynamic fit indices
- factors 4 and 5
    - adaptive testing/ IRT
        - dimensionality assumption and computationally intense
    - CART - tree based adaptive testing (classification trees) always binary split
        - gini index to identify the cut off 
        - POMP method - for differing number of answer formats
- residuals correlates 
- heterogeneity of construct 

The heterogeneous nature of the construct complicates global instrument development and understanding across all participants. The measure is designed for citizens, potentially limiting discrimination at higher item difficulties or among more literate participants, a direction we aim to improve in future studies.


Noteworthy is the inherent approximate, rather than deterministic, nature of metaheuristics (Schultze & Lorenz ,2023; Blum and Roli, 2003).
