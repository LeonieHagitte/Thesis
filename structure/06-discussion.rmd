## Summarising the results

Everything worked - what do I need to report?
First, report on the three core decisions and how the solution was created, whether it is stable, and how it was validated. The final variant is then reported exactly like a CFA (e.g. Jackson et al., 2009). To have a clear structure, answer the following questions:
How large was the original item pool and how was it created?
What is the structure of the scale?
Which algorithm was used (or bruteforce)?
Which objective function was used?
How stable is the final variant?
How was the final variant further validated (e.g. crossvalidate, k-fold)?


## What does it all mean / "Why?"

- Start with the research question
  - Maybe then towards the hypotheses
- connecting findings to the related theories
- very related/ current literature first, than broader is possible
- When discussing the why - be careful, because you didnt test that

## Limitations
- sample
- content validity
- DIF?
- psych science - authors guide to generelizability
- attempts to control for limitating factors
- dont include to general/ broad critiques, but special one for my own study

## Future directions

########################################

Construct validity is evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using MLR as estimator, as well as correlation analyses with related constructs

- what to optimize the scale for?
- dynamic fit indices
- factors 4 and 5
    - adaptive testing/ IRT
        - dimensionality assumption and computationally intense
    - CART - tree based adaptive testing (classification trees) always binary split
        - gini index to identify the cut off 
        - POMP method - for differing number of answer formats
- residuals correlates 
- heterogeneity of construct 

The heterogeneous nature of the construct complicates global instrument development and understanding across all participants. The measure is designed for citizens, potentially limiting discrimination at higher item difficulties or among more literate participants, a direction we aim to improve in future studies.


Noteworthy is the inherent approximate, rather than deterministic, nature of metaheuristics (Schultze & Lorenz ,2023; Blum and Roli, 2003).
