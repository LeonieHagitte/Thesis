# Discussion
- what to optimize the scale for?
- dynamic fit indices
- factors 4 and 5
    - adaptive testing/ IRT
        - dimensionality assumption and computationally intense
    - CART - tree based adaptive testing (classification trees) always binary split
        - gini index to identify the cut off 
        - POMP method - for differing number of answer formats
- residuals correlates 
- heterogeneity of construct 

The heterogeneous nature of the construct complicates global instrument development and understanding across all participants. The measure is designed for citizens, potentially limiting discrimination at higher item difficulties or among more literate participants, a direction we aim to improve in future studies.


Noteworthy is the inherent approximate, rather than deterministic, nature of metaheuristics (Schultze & Lorenz ,2023; Blum and Roli, 2003).
