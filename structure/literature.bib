  abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to propose a \textit{refined conception} of critical thinking in data-rich environments. The rationale for refining critical thinking stems from the need to identify specific information processes that direct the suspension of prior beliefs and activate broader interpretations of data. Established definitions of critical thinking, many of them originating in philosophy, do not include such processes. A refinement of critical thinking in the digital age is developed by integrating two of the most relevant areas of research for this purpose: First, the \textit{tripartite model} of critical thinking is used to outline proactive and reactive information processes in data-rich environments. Second, a new assessment framework is used to illustrate how educational interventions and assessments can be used to incorporate processes outlined in the tripartite model, thus providing a defensible conceptual foundation for inferences about higher-level thinking in data-rich environments. Third, recommendations are provided for how a performance-based teaching and assessment module of critical thinking can be designed.}

  abstract = {Post-secondary data literacy education is critical to students’ academic and career success. However, the literature has not adequately addressed the conceptualization and assessment of data literacy for post-secondary students. In this study, we introduced a novel digital performance-based assessment for teaching and evaluating post-secondary students’ data literacy skills. The purpose of this study is to validate the assessment and identify problematic items for later modifications using the argument-based approach to validation. We analyzed students’ item responses and eye movements using psychometric and eye-tracking analyses to collect two types of validity evidence: internal structure and response processes. Descriptive and psychometric results showed that the nine example items measuring basic data analysis were of acceptable psychometric quality. The eye-tracking analysis of two representative items indicated that most students first attended to and processed expected item areas when the items were available. In addition, the critical item regions for task success were associated with students’ highest cognitive effort. These results rejected our alternative score interpretation that the developed assessment questions evaluate students’ abilities that are weakly connected to the skill of basic data analysis. Possible explanations of the findings and theoretical and pedagogical implications of our study were discussed.}

This matrix might serve as the basis for an operational implementation of different study programs.",

This review article analyzes the development of information overload literature in business administration and related interdisciplinary fields and provides a comprehensive and overarching overview using a bibliometric literature analysis combined with a snowball sampling approach. For the last decade, this article reveals research directions and bridges of literature in a wide range of fields of business administration (e.g., accounting, finance, health management, human resources, innovation management, international management, information systems, marketing, manufacturing, or organizational science). This review article identifies the major papers of various research streams to capture the pulse of the information overload-related research and suggest new questions that could be addressed in the future and identifies concrete open gaps for further research. Furthermore, this article presents a new framework for structuring information overload issues which extends our understanding of influence factors and effects of information overload in the decision-making process.}

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of concern about the proliferation of false and misleading news on social media. Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy—and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.},

  abstract = {Why do people believe blatantly inaccurate news headlines ("fake news")? Do we use our reasoning abilities to convince ourselves that statements that align with our ideology are true, or does reasoning allow us to effectively differentiate fake from real regardless of political ideology? Here we test these competing accounts in two studies (total N = 3446 Mechanical Turk workers) by using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) as a measure of the propensity to engage in analytical reasoning. We find that CRT performance is negatively correlated with the perceived accuracy of fake news, and positively correlated with the ability to discern fake news from real news - even for headlines that align with individuals' political ideology. Moreover, overall discernment was actually better for ideologically aligned headlines than for misaligned headlines. Finally, a headline-level analysis finds that CRT is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively implausible (primarily fake) headlines, and positively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively plausible (primarily real) headlines. In contrast, the correlation between CRT and perceived accuracy is unrelated to how closely the headline aligns with the participant's ideology. Thus, we conclude that analytic thinking is used to assess the plausibility of headlines, regardless of whether the stories are consistent or inconsistent with one's political ideology. Our findings therefore suggest that susceptibility to fake news is driven more by lazy thinking than it is by partisan bias per se - a finding that opens potential avenues for fighting fake news.},

 abstract = {Statistical literacy is a key ability expected of citizens in information-laden societies, and is often touted as an expected outcome of schooling and as a necessary component of adults' numeracy and literacy. Yet, its meaning and building blocks have received little explicit attention. This paper proposes a conceptualization of statistical literacy and describes its key components. Statistical literacy is portrayed as the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate about statistical information and messages. It is argued that statistically literate behavior is predicated on the joint activation of five interrelated knowledge bases (literacy, statistical, mathematical, context, and critical), together with a cluster of supporting dispositions and enabling beliefs. Educational and research implications are discussed, and responsibilities facing educators, statisticians, and other stakeholders are outlined. /// Dans les sociétés qui voient circuler beaucoup d'information, les citoyens doivent absolument savoir lire des données statistique. Cette compétence clé passe souvent pour un résultat attendu de l'enseignement scolaire et pour une dimension nécessaire de la capacité des adultes à savoir lire, écrire et compter. Pourtant, on a accordé peu d'attention à la signification et à la construction de cette compétence. Cet article propose une conceptualisation de l'aptitude à lire des données statistiques et décrit ses aspects essentiels. Savoir lire des données statistique est présenté comme l'aptitude à interpréter, évaluer de façon critique et communiquer sur l'information et les messages statistique. On soutient que cette aptitude se déduit de l'association simultanée de cinq types de connaissances (alphabétisation, statistique, mathématique, contexte et critique), ainsi que de dispositions personnelles et de convictions favorables. Les implications en termes d'éducation et de recherche sont discutées, et on brosse à grands traits les responsabilités des éducateurs, des statisticiens et des autres personnes concernées.},
