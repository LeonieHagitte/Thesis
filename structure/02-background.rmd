# Background

Data Literacy involves the ability to effectively collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data in a critical manner. According to @wolff2016, it means being able to ask and answer everyday questions using both small and large datasets while considering ethical aspects. This includes skills such as selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, criticizing, and interpreting data, as well as communicating insights from data and using data for various purposes. [@frank2016] distinguish between cognitive skills, like data collection and analysis, and social skills, which involve trusting data while maintaining skepticism. [@prado2013] outline five dimensions of Data Literacy: understanding data, acquiring data, interpreting and evaluating data, managing data, and using data. Understanding data includes knowing their types, roles, and significance, while acquiring data involves evaluating and selecting sources. Interpreting and evaluating data encompass understanding different presentation methods and data interpretation. Using data involves preparation, analysis, communication, and ethical considerations. Managing data includes storage, management, and reuse.
This highlights one prominent feature of Data Literacy - It is a heterogeneous concept. Every subject or profession seems to hold their own definition or framework of Data Literacy [@Cui2023]. While that most certainly is good for assessing specific skills (e.g. in an Recruitment test), it limits the generalizability and comparability of Data Literacy across individuals with different background. It furthermore limits the accuracy of communication about the topic as two people with different background might hold different definitions on Data Literacy. 
In the study from [@Cui2023] it also becomes apparent, that one group seems to be underrepresented in the research on Data Literacy: citizens or the general public. 
Although there seem to be several definitions of Data literacy for citizens [@wolff2016], most studies focus on other groups of people. On the first look this appears as a massive oversight, as citizens or the general public is forming the largest group by far, compared to professions like researchers, librarians, students or education provider [@Cui2023]. But when taking a closer look into the concept and its comprising factors,it becomes clear that many of those tend to speak to professionals rather than laypeople. In their Framework [@schüller2020] highlight the different roles in Data Literacy: Some of the facets or skills regard data-consumption, whereas the most are skills that data-producers would have.
This is also reflected when taking a look into related concepts.
The definition proposed by @wolff2016 suggests that data literacy shares some common competencies with statistical and information literacies. Information literacy, often studied in library sciences, overlaps with data literacy in terms of accessing, critically evaluating, and using data sources [@prado2013;@shields2005], @wolff2016 also emphasize the importance of the data inquiry process, starting from identifying problems, designing studies, acquiring data, conducting analysis, to drawing data-based conclusions.
In comparison, @gould2017 argued that data literacy is essentially the same as statistical literacy but with additional competencies needed due to the increasing importance of data. These added competencies include understanding who collects the data, how and why data is collected, and understanding data privacy and ownership. However, while statistical literacy focuses on quantitative data and basic statistics, data literacy extends to the ability to understand, access, evaluate, and use arguments and decision-making based on both quantitative and qualitative data [@Cui2023].

## Data and Information

With the closeness of those topics, it is worth while to take a look into the terminology, before delving deeper into the topic.
When speaking of Data Literacy, one naturally has to think about what data is. What is information, how are they different to each other and what extents do they share? And what role does the process of interpretation play? Does one interpret data to make sense of it? And if so, does that mean that data is entropy while information stands in opposition to it?

The concepts of data and information are foundational in various fields, yet their precise definitions and relationships are often subject to interpretation.
According to Shannon's seminal work on information theory [@shannon1948], data can be understood as raw, unprocessed symbols or observations, devoid of inherent meaning. It is through a process of interpretation and organization that data transforms into information, as elucidated by @bates2005. Bates emphasizes that information emerges when data is structured and presented in a way that is comprehensible and relevant to a particular context or purpose.

Entropy, a concept borrowed from thermodynamics and applied in information theory, plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between data and information. In his landmark paper, @shannon1948 defines entropy as a measure of uncertainty or disorder in a system. In the realm of information theory, entropy is often associated with the amount of unpredictability or randomness in a set of data.
However, it's essential to note that entropy can also be viewed as a measure of information content within a system. This perspective is articulated by @brillouin1953, who suggests that low entropy corresponds to a high concentration of meaningful information. Similarly, the work of @jaynes1957 highlights the connection between entropy and information, proposing that information can be quantified in terms of the reduction of uncertainty or entropy in a system.
Thus, we can refine our understanding of the relationship between data, entropy, and information. While data serves as the raw material from which information is derived, it's the reduction of entropy through organization and interpretation that gives rise to meaningful information. Thus, rather than viewing data as synonymous with entropy, it's more accurate to consider information as emerging from the structured representation of data, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying phenomena.

### Statistical Literacy

Statistical literacy, as defined by Gal (2002), encompasses five knowledge dimensions: literacy skills, statistical knowledge, mathematical knowledge, contextual knowledge, and critical reflection skills, along with two dispositional dimensions: beliefs and attitudes, and a critical mindset. It involves understanding written, spoken, or graphical information, knowing why data are needed, grasping basic statistical concepts, understanding probability, and drawing statistical inferences. It also includes basic mathematical operations, interpreting information within a context, and critically questioning the validity of information, particularly in media. Statistical literacy requires a critical attitude and the perception of oneself as competent in statistical reasoning.

### Information Literacy

Information literacy is the ability to recognize when information is needed and to effectively locate, evaluate, and use that information (American Library Association (2000). Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education. http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency ). It empowers individuals to determine the extent of information needed, access it efficiently, critically evaluate information and their sources, incorporate information into their knowledge base, and use it effectively for specific purposes. Additionally, information literacy involves understanding the legal, economic, and social aspects of information use and ensuring ethical and legal access and use of information.
Furthermore, Information literacy is not static; it involves a commitment to lifelong learning and adaptation to evolving information technologies and practices.
This definition already highlights the closeness of Information literacy to Data Literacy.
Another possible way to describe it is suggested by Johnson and Webber (2003):
“Information literacy is the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to obtain,through whatever channel or medium, information well fitted to information needs,together with critical awareness of the importance of wise and ethical use of information in society.” (Johnston & Webber, 2003, p.336)

Also similar to Data Literacy, is its heterogeneous nature. This already becomes apparent when looking at the different frameworks for Information literacy. In the UK, the seven Pillars of IL model was published in 1999 by the SCONUL Advisory Committee on Information Literacy. In 2001, the Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy developed its IL framework, which was revised in 2004 by Bundy. A year later, Mexican standards for IL in higher education were established, influenced significantly by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Standards published in 2000. Work on the Scottish IL framework began in 2004, as documented by Irving in 2011. IL was also a focal point in a European project aimed at revitalizing the European library and information science curriculum, identifying essential topics and teaching methods (Virkus, S., Boekhorst, A.K., Gomez-Hernandez, J.A., Skov, C., & Webber, S. (2005). Information literacy: Conceptions, context and the formation of a discipline.).

The framework of [@schüller2020] shows that citizens are mainly covering roles where they consume data/ data products or informations.
Thus, they are most likely to find tasks or items regarding the producing facets like providing or exploiting data more difficult to answer. This would systematically impair the fairness of tests and questionnaires regarding Data Literacy. @kubinger2005 define fairness as the condition where test measurements or values do not discriminate against specific groups of people who are relevant to the test. In the case of Data Literacy it is to be expected, that the item-difficulties in the producing factors would not be evenly distributed. As you cant just leave any factors out of the construct, in order to create a concept that is fair, it would be neccessary to find a way to have the same factors in the concept with the same distribution of difficulty for all groups of participants. 

## Conceptual Integration 

Thus, conceptual integration was employed to find common grounds of the existing theories and studies. 
By synthesizing heterogeneous definitions and perspectives into cohesive, unified representations and selectively incorporating relevant features while establishing cross-disciplinary connections, conceptual integration enables researchers to create comprehensive latent factors that capture the complexity of the construct.
Therefore we arrived at the following structure of the concept.

Data literacy is the ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data effectively. It involves asking and answering real-world questions from datasets while considering ethical use. Core skills include selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, presenting, critiquing, and interpreting data and their sources.
The concept comprises Data Comprehension and Interpretation, Contextualize and Evaluate Data, Data-Informed Worldview, Data Communication Proficiency and Data Management and Analysis. On those Factors people can exhibit different levels of literacy, expanding the definition above the static nature into a more dynamic one.

### Data Comprehension and Interpretation  
This factor encompasses skills related to understanding and critically evaluating data and information. It involves the ability to comprehend various forms of data presentation, detect inconsistencies, interpret data comprehensively, and identify logical fallacies. Individuals with high scores on this factor demonstrate a strong aptitude for processing and making sense of complex information across different formats, enabling them to draw accurate conclusions and insights.

### Contextualize and Evaluate Data  
This factor involves skills related to critically evaluating information sources and discerning between facts and opinions. It encompasses the ability to assess the credibility and reliability of information, considering factors such as the reputation of the source and the context in which the information was presented. Individuals scoring high on this factor demonstrate a keen awareness of potential biases or vested interests in information sources.

### Data-Informed Worldview  
This factor relates to the ability to integrate data-driven insights into one's worldview and values. It involves actively seeking comprehensive understanding of various topics, engaging with diverse perspectives, and consciously incorporating data-driven insights. Individuals high in this factor adapt their opinions based on new data, prefer evidence-based information, and ensure their values align with reliable data. They engage with information and perspectives that challenge their existing views, showing a willingness to reassess their opinions and positions based on new data.

### Data Communication Proficiency  
This factor revolves around the skill to effectively communicate and present data through various means, including visual formats, verbal explanations, and written descriptions.
It requires translating complex data into clear and impactful formats, ensuring comprehension by varied audiences. Proficiency in data communication is essential for facilitating understanding, aiding informed decision-making, and prompting action based on data-driven insights. This proficiency includes the ability to translate data into simple visualizations, present findings confidently, and articulate complex information effectively in written and visual as well as verbal formats. It involves adeptly summarizing extensive datasets, engaging in professional discussions, and using advanced visual elements to convey specialized results to target audiences.

### Data Management and Analysis  
This factor covers skills related to managing and analyzing data effectively. It involves proficiency in organizing and analyzing data using software tools, conducting statistical analyses, and understanding research methodologies.
It includes skills such as organizing and managing data using software tools, conducting interviews or surveys for data collection, performing basic statistical analysis and recognizing trends in graphical representations. Individuals scoring high on this factor exhibit competence in statistical methods, enabling them to effectively analyze data and interpret findings.

## Delineation from other concepts  
In line with the framework of @schüller2020 the concept entails ethical data-use, but only at the hightest difficulty of data management. And the factors Data Comprehension and Interpretation, Contextualize and Evaluate Data and Data-Informed Worldview are representing the application areas for consumers. So they are relevant for all people in scociety, whereas the other factors, those speaking to people who are considered "producers", are only common for smaller groups of people or certain professions.  
This structure encompasses certain characteristics from Statistical Literacy as well as from Information Literacy.
The integration of statistical literacy and information literacy within the framework of data literacy is an essential aspect to consider as those concepts are so closely related. 

### What it takes  
This definition incorporates statistical literacy by emphasizing data interpretation, analysis, and understanding different types of data representations, such as graphs and tables (Data Handling and Analysis). It includes elements of information literacy by focusing on evaluating the credibility of data sources, considering factors like reputation and biases, which are similar to assessing the quality of information sources (Contextualize and Evaluate Data).
Both statistical and information literacy involve using data and information to make informed decisions. Your framework emphasizes integrating data-driven insights into ones opinions and values, that then later on influence decision-making processes, aligning with the goals of statistical and information literacy.

### What it leaves  
Statistical literacy often focuses more narrowly on statistical concepts and methods, such as probability, sampling, and hypothesis testing. This definition encompasses a broader range of skills beyond statistical concepts, such as data visualization, software usage, and understanding data collection methods. While statistical literacy often involve analyzing existing data, this definition also includes skills related to producing and manipulating data, such as creating visualizations and using software tools. This aspect goes beyond traditional statistical literacy and aligns more closely with data literacy.  
While information literacy involves assessing the quality of information sources, this definition places a particular emphasis on assessing data quality, considering factors like sample size, biases, and data context. This aspect extends beyond traditional information literacy and is more specific to data literacy.

## Aim of the Study  
Our goal was to derive a holistic definition of data literacy based on existing approaches and to develop a questionnaire for self-perceived data literacy, measuring the three core factors of the construct (First drafts of items for two additional factors were included as preliminary assessments for future studies, but were not the goal of this study). To achieve this, essential factors from various disciplines were integrated via the review of relevant literature to develop a theory- driven conceptualization of the construct - Data Literacy. We used this, combined with the person-related empirical method to derive items as indicators for different constructs, that via the nomological network form Data Literacy. Furthermore, an iterative process for item creation and refinement was applied. Afterwards, all Items left were assessed and then the best items were chosen for a final selection.

## Self-Perceived Data Literacy 

instances have underscored the extent to which citizens may lack awareness regarding the potential uses and misuses of their data. [argumentation for self-rating measure!]


## Moral Attentiveness

- moral disengagement scale

Moral Attentiveness [@reynolds2008] is a concept that delves into the inherent differences individuals display when it comes to engaging with ethical considerations. Some individuals naturally exhibit a genuine interest and attentiveness to ethical matters, while others may find the subject mundane or remain indifferent, and in extreme cases, appear unresponsive. This inclination toward or against ethics appears to be deeply ingrained, persisting across diverse contexts and proving resistant to various ethics interventions, whether constructive or detrimental.
Importantly, acknowledging one's interest in ethics does not imply inherent moral virtue or vice, nor does it suggest that behavior is rigid and unchangeable. Rather, it highlights an observation familiar to many practitioners — that certain individuals inherently pay more attention to moral matters. These individuals contribute to making organizational interventions more interactive, enjoyable, and presumably more beneficial compared to those less attuned to such ethical considerations.
Within the field, an implicit assumption is that the variance in individual moral attentiveness can be explained by two existing constructs: moral awareness and moral sensitivity. Moral awareness involves an individual's recognition that a situation possesses moral implications, while moral sensitivity refers to their capacity to achieve such moral awareness. In essence, the unspoken argument is that an individual's level of attention to moral matters can be attributed to their moral awareness, moral sensitivity, or a combination of both.

## Critical Thinking

The conceptualization of Critical Thinking (CrT) has evolved along three main branches: philosophical, psychological, and educational [@rear2019]. In the philosophical view, which centers on the mental process of thought, a critical thinker is someone adept at logically evaluating and questioning both the assumptions of others and their own. On the psychological front, which delves into the processes driving action, a critical thinker possesses a combination of skills enabling them to assess a situation and determine the most appropriate course of action. The educational approach aligns more closely with the psychological perspective, relying on frameworks and learning activities tailored to enhance students' CrT skills and subsequently assess their proficiency in these skills [@payan2022].

## Need for Cognition 

The personality trait known as Need for Cognition (NFC) originated in social psychology during the 1940s and 1950s, the concept of NFC, representing an inclination for joyful thinking, is evident in the works of @maslow1943, @murphy1947, @asch1952, and @sarnoff1954. The conceptualization of NFC underwent refinement in the mid-1950s through experimental investigations by Cohen and colleagues [@cohen1955]. They defined NFC as "a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways. It is a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world" [@cohen1955, p. 291]. The concept captures individual variations in the engagement and enjoyment of thinking tasks [@bless1994]. 

## Core self evaluation

Core Self-Evaluations (CSE) is a comprehensive personality trait that encompasses fundamental appraisals of one's worthiness, effectiveness, and capability as a person [@judge2003]. This construct, initially introduced by @judge1997, integrates four traits: self-esteem, emotional stability, generalized self-efficacy, and locus of control, all of which contribute to individuals' perceptions of themselves and their agency [@judge2001].

The study by @chang2012 further emphasizes the role of CSE in individuals' assessments of their own worthiness and capabilities. These assessments, rooted in self-esteem, emotional stability, generalized self-efficacy, and locus of control, form the core components of CSE [@judge2003]. Self-esteem, as established by @rosenberg1965, provides a foundation for positive self-perceptions, while emotional stability (low neuroticism) characterized by confidence and steadiness [@goldberg1990] enhances individuals' resilience. Generalized self-efficacy, reflecting beliefs about one's ability to perform across diverse situations [@locke1996], and locus of control, which pertains to individuals' beliefs about the causes of events in their lives [@rotter1966], further shape individuals' perceptions of their capabilities and control over their environment.

## Openness towards technology

The widespread integration of information and communication technology (ICT) in various aspects of daily life, notably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (Richter and Mohr, 2020; Rizun and Strzelecki, 2020), has underscored the significance of individuals' self-perceived ICT competence. This self-perception extends beyond a general assessment to encompass specific competence domains, referred to as ICT self-concept (ICT-SC). ICT-SC reflects individuals' mental representations and evaluations of their ICT competences shaped by experiences, feedback, and interactions with the environment.

Research findings indicate that when the objective demands of competence encompass multiple dimensions, the corresponding self-concepts are likewise structured in a multidimensional fashion (Brunner et al., 2010). Examining the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp) and its updated versions, DigComp 2.0/2.1 (Carretero et al., 2017; Vuorikari et al., 2016), reveals a comprehensive structure. This framework not only integrates previous models of ICT competence but also extends its scope, incorporating models such as the Canadian Digital Skill Framework (Chinien and Boutin, 2011) and components of ICT literacy by Katz (2007), among others (e.g., Eshet-Alkalai, 2004; Ferrari, 2012; Martin and Grudziecki, 2006).
Within DigComp and its subsequent versions, ICT competence is systematically organized across five competence domains: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving. These domains encompass a total of 21 competences, providing a comprehensive and nuanced perspective on the multifaceted nature of ICT competence.
