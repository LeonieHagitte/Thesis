# Background

In "Thinking, Fast and Slow," @kahneman2011 introduces the two systems of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 operates swiftly, relying on intuition and often succumbing to biases, while System 2 operates more deliberately, engaging in analytical thinking. Kahneman's exploration extends to the realization that even experts across diverse domains can fall prey to cognitive biases, leading to errors in judgment [@kahneman2011].
Applying Kahneman's insights to the realm of data literacy and research questions sheds light on a critical aspect. It underscores the notion that individuals, irrespective of their statistical expertise, remain vulnerable to cognitive biases when interpreting and analyzing data. In the current societal landscape, where data plays an increasingly pivotal role in shaping decisions and policies, acknowledging and addressing these cognitive biases becomes paramount.

## Aim of the Study
We noticed several gaps in the current research that we want to try addressing with this study. For once the target groups for Data Literacy are currently each having their own definition of the construct it seems [@Cui2023]. This not only makes comparisons impossible but also makes a general understanding of the topic as well as communication in the community and science communication to the public harder. 

## Data and Information

When speaking of Data Literacy, the respective self-perception and how to define and measure both constructs, one naturally has to think about what data is. What is information, how are they different to each other and what extents do they share? And what role does the process of interpretation play? Does one interpret data to make sense of it? And if so, does that mean that data is entropy while information stands in opposition to it?

The concepts of data and information are foundational in various fields, yet their precise definitions and relationships are often subject to interpretation.
According to Shannon's seminal work on information theory [@shannon1948], data can be understood as raw, unprocessed symbols or observations, devoid of inherent meaning. It is through a process of interpretation and organization that data transforms into information, as elucidated by @bates2005. Bates emphasizes that information emerges when data is structured and presented in a way that is comprehensible and relevant to a particular context or purpose.

Entropy, a concept borrowed from thermodynamics and applied in information theory, plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between data and information. In his landmark paper, @shannon1948 defines entropy as a measure of uncertainty or disorder in a system. In the realm of information theory, entropy is often associated with the amount of unpredictability or randomness in a set of data.
However, it's essential to note that entropy can also be viewed as a measure of information content within a system. This perspective is articulated by @brillouin1953, who suggests that low entropy corresponds to a high concentration of meaningful information. Similarly, the work of @jaynes1957 highlights the connection between entropy and information, proposing that information can be quantified in terms of the reduction of uncertainty or entropy in a system.
Thus, we can refine our understanding of the relationship between data, entropy, and information. While data serves as the raw material from which information is derived, it's the reduction of entropy through organization and interpretation that gives rise to meaningful information. Thus, rather than viewing data as synonymous with entropy, it's more accurate to consider information as emerging from the structured representation of data, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying phenomena.

## Self-Perceived Data Literacy 

instances have underscored the extent to which citizens may lack awareness regarding the potential uses and misuses of their data. [argumentation for self-rating measure!]

## Conceptual Integration 

Conceptual integration was employed to find common grounds of the existing theories and studies. 
By synthesizing heterogeneous definitions and perspectives into cohesive, unified representations and selectively incorporating relevant features while establishing cross-disciplinary connections, conceptual integration enables researchers to create comprehensive latent factors that capture the complexity of the construct.

## Data Comprehension and Interpretation

This factor encompasses skills related to understanding and critically evaluating data and information. It involves the ability to comprehend various forms of data presentation, detect inconsistencies, interpret data comprehensively, and identify logical fallacies. Individuals with high scores on this factor demonstrate a strong aptitude for processing and making sense of complex information across different formats, enabling them to draw accurate conclusions and insights.

## Contextualize, Evaluate and Critique Data
This factor involves skills related to critically evaluating information sources and discerning between facts and opinions. It encompasses the ability to assess the credibility and reliability of information, considering factors such as the reputation of the source and the context in which the information was presented. Individuals scoring high on this factor demonstrate a keen awareness of potential biases or vested interests in information sources.

## Data-Informed Worldview

This factor assesses individuals' ability to integrate data and information into decision-making, problem-solving, and personal or professional perspectives. It involves actively seeking comprehensive understanding of various topics, engaging with diverse perspectives, and consciously incorporating data-driven insights. Individuals high in this factor adapt their opinions based on new data, prefer evidence-based information, and ensure their values align with reliable data. They engage with information and perspectives that challenge their existing views, showing a willingness to reassess their opinions and positions based on new data, while recognizing instances of data manipulation in graphical representations.

## Data Communication Proficiency

This factor pertains to the skill of effectively conveying data insights through diverse mediums like visualization, presentations, and reports. It requires translating complex data into clear and impactful formats, ensuring comprehension by varied audiences. Proficiency in data communication is essential for facilitating understanding, aiding informed decision-making, and prompting action based on data-driven insights. This proficiency includes the ability to translate data into simple visualizations, present findings confidently, and articulate complex information effectively in both written and visual formats. It involves adeptly summarizing extensive datasets, engaging in professional discussions, and using advanced visual elements to convey specialized results to target audiences.

## Data Handling and Statistical Literacy

This latent factor reflects individuals' proficiency in handling data and their familiarity with statistical concepts and techniques. It includes skills such as organizing and managing data using software tools, conducting interviews or surveys for data collection, performing basic statistical analysis, recognizing trends in graphical representations, and accessing information from various sources. Individuals scoring high on this factor exhibit competence in both basic and advanced statistical methods, enabling them to effectively analyze data, interpret findings, and make informed decisions. Additionally, they demonstrate proficiency in managing complex datasets and possess a deep understanding of statistical principles essential for rigorous data analysis.

## Moral Attentiveness

- moral disengagement scale

Moral Attentiveness [@reynolds2008] is a concept that delves into the inherent differences individuals display when it comes to engaging with ethical considerations. Some individuals naturally exhibit a genuine interest and attentiveness to ethical matters, while others may find the subject mundane or remain indifferent, and in extreme cases, appear unresponsive. This inclination toward or against ethics appears to be deeply ingrained, persisting across diverse contexts and proving resistant to various ethics interventions, whether constructive or detrimental.
Importantly, acknowledging one's interest in ethics does not imply inherent moral virtue or vice, nor does it suggest that behavior is rigid and unchangeable. Rather, it highlights an observation familiar to many practitioners â€” that certain individuals inherently pay more attention to moral matters. These individuals contribute to making organizational interventions more interactive, enjoyable, and presumably more beneficial compared to those less attuned to such ethical considerations.
Within the field, an implicit assumption is that the variance in individual moral attentiveness can be explained by two existing constructs: moral awareness and moral sensitivity. Moral awareness involves an individual's recognition that a situation possesses moral implications, while moral sensitivity refers to their capacity to achieve such moral awareness. In essence, the unspoken argument is that an individual's level of attention to moral matters can be attributed to their moral awareness, moral sensitivity, or a combination of both.

## Critical Thinking

The conceptualization of Critical Thinking (CrT) has evolved along three main branches: philosophical, psychological, and educational [@rear2019]. In the philosophical view, which centers on the mental process of thought, a critical thinker is someone adept at logically evaluating and questioning both the assumptions of others and their own. On the psychological front, which delves into the processes driving action, a critical thinker possesses a combination of skills enabling them to assess a situation and determine the most appropriate course of action. The educational approach aligns more closely with the psychological perspective, relying on frameworks and learning activities tailored to enhance students' CrT skills and subsequently assess their proficiency in these skills [@payan2022].

## Need for Cognition 

The personality trait known as Need for Cognition (NFC) originated in social psychology during the 1940s and 1950s, the concept of NFC, representing an inclination for joyful thinking, is evident in the works of @maslow1943, @murphy1947, @asch1952, and @sarnoff1954. The conceptualization of NFC underwent refinement in the mid-1950s through experimental investigations by Cohen and colleagues [@cohen1955]. They defined NFC as "a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways. It is a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world" [@cohen1955, p. 291]. The concept captures individual variations in the engagement and enjoyment of thinking tasks [@bless1994]. 

## Core self evaluation

Core Self-Evaluations (CSE) is a comprehensive personality trait that encompasses fundamental appraisals of one's worthiness, effectiveness, and capability as a person [@judge2003]. This construct, initially introduced by @judge1997, integrates four traits: self-esteem, emotional stability, generalized self-efficacy, and locus of control, all of which contribute to individuals' perceptions of themselves and their agency [@judge2001].

The study by @chang2012 further emphasizes the role of CSE in individuals' assessments of their own worthiness and capabilities. These assessments, rooted in self-esteem, emotional stability, generalized self-efficacy, and locus of control, form the core components of CSE [@judge2003]. Self-esteem, as established by @rosenberg1965, provides a foundation for positive self-perceptions, while emotional stability (low neuroticism) characterized by confidence and steadiness [@goldberg1990] enhances individuals' resilience. Generalized self-efficacy, reflecting beliefs about one's ability to perform across diverse situations [@locke1996], and locus of control, which pertains to individuals' beliefs about the causes of events in their lives [@rotter1966], further shape individuals' perceptions of their capabilities and control over their environment.

## Openness towards technology

The widespread integration of information and communication technology (ICT) in various aspects of daily life, notably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (Richter and Mohr, 2020; Rizun and Strzelecki, 2020), has underscored the significance of individuals' self-perceived ICT competence. This self-perception extends beyond a general assessment to encompass specific competence domains, referred to as ICT self-concept (ICT-SC). ICT-SC reflects individuals' mental representations and evaluations of their ICT competences shaped by experiences, feedback, and interactions with the environment.

Research findings indicate that when the objective demands of competence encompass multiple dimensions, the corresponding self-concepts are likewise structured in a multidimensional fashion (Brunner et al., 2010). Examining the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp) and its updated versions, DigComp 2.0/2.1 (Carretero et al., 2017; Vuorikari et al., 2016), reveals a comprehensive structure. This framework not only integrates previous models of ICT competence but also extends its scope, incorporating models such as the Canadian Digital Skill Framework (Chinien and Boutin, 2011) and components of ICT literacy by Katz (2007), among others (e.g., Eshet-Alkalai, 2004; Ferrari, 2012; Martin and Grudziecki, 2006).
Within DigComp and its subsequent versions, ICT competence is systematically organized across five competence domains: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving. These domains encompass a total of 21 competences, providing a comprehensive and nuanced perspective on the multifaceted nature of ICT competence.
