# Background

In the current digital age characterized by an overwhelming influx especially of online information, it is imperative to accurately distinguish credible, well-substantiated news from various forms of rumors, misinformation, and falsehoods. Previous research has examined our capacity to assess the trustworthiness of news sources and the subsequent effects on online behaviors, such as information-sharing practices [e.g., @Pennycook2021; @Pennycook2019].
Thus, the relevance of data literacy in today's society becomes evident as it serves as a potent tool in navigating the complex data-driven environment. In a world characterized by information overload and rapid technological advancements, individuals equipped with strong data literacy skills can discern patterns, critically evaluate information, and make informed decisions.
The exploration of citizens' interaction with media and the cultivation of their agency has traditionally centered around concepts such as written literacy, media literacy, information literacy, and digital literacy. In more recent discussions, data literacy has been approaching relevance among discussed competencies regarding what is necessary for agency in the current society [@Carmi2020]. Deficiency in data literacy not only exposes individuals to various risks and harms on personal, social, physical, and financial levels but also constrains their capacity to actively engage as informed citizens within an evolving, data-driven society [@Carmi2020]. Thus, data literacy is a competency that is becoming increasingly important to everyone. And research has acknowledged this in recent years, as more and more research is being done in that direction [@Cui2023]. This study aims to complement the current research, with a self rating questionnaire for assessing data literacy among citizens.

Data literacy involves the ability to effectively collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data in a critical manner. According to @wolff2016, it means being able to ask and answer everyday questions using both small and large datasets while considering ethical aspects. This includes skills such as selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, criticizing, and interpreting data, as well as communicating insights from data and using data for various purposes. [@frank2016] distinguish between cognitive skills, like data collection and analysis, and social skills, which involve trusting data while maintaining skepticism. [@prado2013] outline five dimensions of data literacy: understanding data, acquiring data, interpreting and evaluating data, managing data, and using data. Understanding data includes knowing their types, roles, and significance, while acquiring data involves evaluating and selecting sources. Interpreting and evaluating data encompass understanding different presentation methods and data interpretation. Using data involves preparation, analysis, communication, and ethical considerations. Managing data includes storage, management, and reuse. 
This highlights one prominent feature of data literacy - It is a heterogeneous concept. Every subject or profession seems to hold their own definition or framework of data literacy [@Cui2023]. While that most certainly is good for assessing specific skills (e.g. in an Recruitment test), it limits the generalisability and comparability of data literacy across individuals with different background. It furthermore limits the accuracy of communication about the topic as two people with different background might hold different definitions on data literacy. In the study from [@Cui2023] it also becomes apparent, that one group seems to be underrepresented in the research on data literacy: citizens or the general public. 
Despite being the largest demographic group, citizens are often overlooked in favor of other professions such as researchers, librarians, students, or educators[@Cui2023]. This trend raises questions about the emphasis on certain aspects of data literacy, many of which tend to align more closely with professional roles than with the needs of laypeople [@schüller2020].
In their Framework [@schüller2020] highlight the different roles in data literacy: Some of the facets or skills regard "data-consumption", whereas the most are skills "data-producers" would have. This is also reflected when taking a look into related concepts. The definition proposed by @wolff2016 suggests that data literacy shares some common competencies with statistical and information literacies.  

Information literacy, often studied in library sciences, overlaps with data literacy in terms of accessing, critically evaluating, and using data sources [@prado2013;@shields2005], @wolff2016 also emphasize the importance of the data inquiry process, starting from identifying problems, designing studies, acquiring data, conducting analysis, to drawing data-based conclusions.
In comparison, @gould2017 argued that data literacy is essentially the same as statistical literacy but with additional competencies needed due to the increasing importance of data. These added competencies include understanding who collects the data, how and why data is collected, and understanding data privacy and ownership [@gould2017]. 
However, while statistical literacy focuses on quantitative data and basic statistics, data literacy extends to the ability to understand, access, evaluate, and use arguments and decision-making based on both quantitative and qualitative data [@Cui2023].
  
It is worthwhile to clarify the terminology surrounding those intertwined concepts of data and information. When discussing data literacy, it's essential to understand the distinctions between these terms and their relationship to one another.
The concepts of data and information are foundational in various fields, yet their precise definitions and relationships are often subject to interpretation. In essence, data can be thought of as raw, unprocessed symbols or observations, lacking inherent meaning, as outlined in Shannon's seminal work on information theory [@shannon1948]. @bates2005 emphasizes that data evolves into information through interpretation and organization, becoming comprehensible and relevant within a specific context or purpose. Does that mean that data is entropy while information stands in opposition to it?  
Not necessarily. @shannon1948 defines entropy as a measure of uncertainty or disorder in a system. In information theory, entropy is often associated with the amount of unpredictability or randomness in a set of data. However, entropy can also be viewed as a measure of information content within a system. This perspective is articulated by @brillouin1953, who suggests that low entropy corresponds to a high concentration of meaningful information. Similarly, the work of @jaynes1957 highlights the connection between entropy and information, proposing that information can be quantified in terms of the reduction of uncertainty or entropy in a system.
So, while data serves as the raw material from which information is derived, it's the reduction of entropy through organization and interpretation that becomes meaningful information. Thus, rather than viewing data as synonymous with entropy or information, it's more accurate to consider information as emerging from the structured representation of data.  
The framework of [@schüller2020] suggests that citizens primarily engage in roles where they consume data or information. Consequently, they may encounter difficulties with tasks or items related to producing facets such as providing or exploiting data. This imbalance could potentially undermine the fairness of tests and questionnaires designed to assess data literacy. Particularly, if these assessments prioritize data and statistical literacy over information literacy. Therefore, our objective was to formulate a definition that adequately addresses both domains, ensuring a balanced representation.

## Conceptual Integration  
Thus, via conceptual integration arrived at thefollowing definition: data literacy is the ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data effectively. It involves asking and answering real-world questions from datasets while considering ethical use. Core skills include selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, presenting, critiquing, and interpreting data, information and their sources.
The construct can be structured in five facets (Comprehension,Evaluation, Integration, Communication & Statistics) that are also very prominent in most definitions in the literature (Cui et al., 2023). We further divided them into “consumer” facets (Comprehension,Evaluation & Integration), that are relevant for nearly every person in society, from citizens up. And “producer” facets (Communication & Statistics), that are mainly relevant for people, actively working with data.  

### Comprehension 
This factor encompasses skills related to understanding and critically evaluating data and information. It involves the ability to comprehend various forms of data presentation, detect inconsistencies, interpret data comprehensively, and identify logical fallacies. Individuals with high scores on this factor demonstrate a strong aptitude for processing and making sense of complex information across different formats, enabling them to draw accurate conclusions and insights.  

### Evaluation 
This factor involves skills related to critically evaluating information sources and discerning between facts and opinions. It encompasses the ability to assess the credibility and reliability of information, considering factors such as the reputation of the source and the context in which the information was presented. Individuals scoring high on this factor demonstrate a keen awareness of potential biases or vested interests in information sources.  

### Integration  
This factor relates to the ability to integrate data-driven insights into one's worldview and values. It involves actively seeking comprehensive understanding of various topics, engaging with diverse perspectives, and consciously incorporating data-driven insights. Individuals high in this factor adapt their opinions based on new data, prefer evidence-based information, and ensure their values align with reliable data. They engage with information and perspectives that challenge their existing views, showing a willingness to reassess their opinions and positions based on new data.  

### Communication  
This factor revolves around the skill to effectively communicate and present data through various means, including visual formats, verbal explanations, and written descriptions.
It requires translating complex data into clear and impactful formats, ensuring comprehension by varied audiences. Proficiency in data communication is essential for facilitating understanding, aiding informed decision-making, and prompting action based on data-driven insights. This proficiency includes the ability to translate data into simple visualizations, present findings confidently, and articulate complex information effectively in written and visual as well as verbal formats. It involves adeptly summarizing extensive datasets, engaging in professional discussions, and using advanced visual elements to convey specialized results to target audiences.  

### Statistics 
This factor covers skills related to managing and analyzing data effectively. It involves proficiency in organizing and analyzing data using software tools, conducting statistical analyses, and understanding research methodologies.
It includes skills such as organizing and managing data using software tools, conducting interviews or surveys for data collection, performing basic statistical analysis and recognizing trends in graphical representations. Individuals scoring high on this factor exhibit competence in statistical methods, enabling them to effectively analyze data and interpret findings.  

## Delineation from other concepts - The nomological net   
This structure encompasses certain characteristics and behaviors from critical thinking, media competency, technology competency, statistical Literacy as well as from information literacy. 
Our definition incorporates statistical literacy [@Gal2002] by emphasizing data interpretation, analysis, and understanding different types of data representations, such as graphs and tables (Statistics). It includes elements of information literacy [@ACRL2000] by focusing on evaluating the credibility of data sources, considering factors like reputation and biases, similar to assessing the quality of information sources (Evaluation & Integration)[@Webber2017]. Both statistical and information literacy involve using data and information to make informed decisions[@Webber2017; @Gal2002]. data literacy emphasizes integrating data-driven insights into one's opinions and values, which influence decision-making processes, thereby aligning with the goals of statistical and information literacy. The factor "Comprehension" encompasses behaviors and skills associated with critical thinking [@rear2019; @payan2022], such as identifying weaknesses in one's reasoning or actively shaping discourse and public dissemination of information. The factors "Evaluation" and "Statistics" encompass behaviors and skills related to technology competency, including navigating and critically evaluating online sources and platforms, using information and communication technology, and utilizing statistical software. The "consumer" factors are closely related to media literacy, focusing on skills related to critically analyzing and interpreting various media formats for understanding and engaging with media content.  
In contrast, statistical literacy often focuses more narrowly on statistical concepts and methods, such as probability, sampling, and hypothesis testing [@Gal2002]. Our definition encompasses a broader range of skills beyond statistical concepts, such as data visualization, software usage, and understanding data collection methods. While information literacy involves assessing the quality of information sources, our definition places a particular emphasis on assessing data quality, considering factors like sample size, biases, and data context. This aspect extends beyond traditional information literacy [@ACRL2000] and is more specific to data literacy. data literacy involves proficiency in using technology, but specifically focuses on understanding and working with data. Technology competency encompasses a broader set of digital skills that extend beyond those relevant for data literacy.

## Discrimminant Constructs  
### Need for Cognition  
The personality trait known as Need for Cognition (NFC) originated in social psychology during the 1940s and 1950s, the concept of NFC, representing an inclination for joyful thinking, is evident in the works of @maslow1943, @murphy1947, @asch1952, and @sarnoff1954. The conceptualization of NFC underwent refinement in the mid-1950s through experimental investigations by Cohen and colleagues [@cohen1955]. They defined NFC as "a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways. It is a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world" [@cohen1955, p. 291]. The concept captures individual variations in the engagement and enjoyment of thinking tasks [@bless1994]. 

### Opennes to new experiences   
Openness to experience reflects a broad appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unconventional ideas, imagination, curiosity, and diverse experiences. Individuals high in openness tend to be intellectually curious, receptive to emotions, appreciative of beauty, and eager to explore new possibilities. They are often more creative and emotionally attuned compared to those low in openness. However, they may also be perceived as unpredictable and prone to engaging in risky behaviors, including drug use (Ambridge, 2014). High openness is associated with seeking intense and euphoric experiences as a means of self-actualization. In contrast, individuals low in openness tend to seek fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven, sometimes viewed as dogmatic or closed-minded. The interpretation and contextualization of the openness factor remain debated, partly due to a lack of biological evidence supporting this trait. Unlike other personality traits, openness has not shown consistent associations with specific brain regions in neuroimaging studies (DeYoung et al., 2010).

### Conscientiousness  
Conscientiousness refers to an individual's propensity for self-discipline, dutifulness, and striving for achievement in alignment with external standards or expectations. It encompasses levels of impulse control, regulation, and goal-directed behavior. High conscientiousness is characterized by persistence and focus, often perceived as stubbornness, whereas low conscientiousness is linked to flexibility and spontaneity, potentially manifesting as carelessness and unreliability (Toegel & Barsoux, 2012). Individuals with high conscientiousness tend to prefer planned actions over spontaneous ones (Costa & McCrae, 1992).  

## Aim of the Study  
My aim was to derive a comprehensive definition of data literacy based on existing approaches and to develop a questionnaire for self-perceived data literacy, measuring the three core factors of the construct. While drafts for two additional factors are included as preliminary assessments for future studies, they are not the focus of this study.
