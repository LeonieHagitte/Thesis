<p>This study meant to examine whether a pool 20 items out of the initial item pool of 71 items, would reflect the suggested measurement model within the current sample. Furthermore, the aim was to find a solution via ‘stuart’ that yields good model fit as well as reliability and that shows measurement invariance with a random split-sample. Additionally, latent correlations were to be examined to locate the construct in the nomological net.
The model demonstrating the best overall fit was selected based on a set of 20 items representing five factors: Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication, and Statistics, each with four items. The model exhibited an acceptable fit, with indices suggesting good model quality (RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.08, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.96), according to the combinational rule for RMSEA and SRMR of <span class="citation">Hu &amp; Bentler (<a href="#ref-hu1999">1999</a>)</span>. The factor loadings ranged from 0.09 to 0.82 across the five factors, and the model’s total McDonald’s <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> was 0.92, indicating reliable internal consistency.
Comparison of the training sample and the test sample regarding measurement invariance suggests that scalar invariance holds (vgl. table X).
In practical terms, when scalar invariance holds, the factor loadings, intercepts, and measurement scales acan be considered equivalent across groups. This allows for meaningful comparisons of latent means between groups rather than being due to measurement bias or differences in how the construct is understood or measured across groups.
The lack of residual invariance suggests that the residuals (unexplained variance in the indicators) are not equivalent across groups. This implies that there are group-specific differences in how much of the variance in the observed variables remains unexplained by the latent factors. In practical terms, this lack of residual invariance complicates the interpretation of differences between groups. While the factors themselves may be measured similarly (if scalar invariance holds), the amount of unexplained variability in the responses differs across groups, indicating potential unmodeled differences in how the groups respond to certain items.
As a result, any observed differences in the latent factors could be influenced by differing error variances across groups, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about true group differences. Thus, while latent means can be compared (under scalar invariance), the comparisons may be confounded by measurement error that varies across groups.</p>
<p>Further investigation of residuals revealed correlated residuals, indicating potential specification errors, both in the training and test samples. The latent correlations among factors were generally strong, especially between Communication and Statistics (0.97 in the training sample and 0.84 in the test sample). Additionally, the data literacy factors showed moderate to high correlations with external measures, including the SWE-IV-16, NFC-K, and ICT-SC25. The data literacy factors also exhibited small to moderate correlations with personality traits, such as negative correlations with openness and positive correlations with conscientiousness.</p>
<p>Control variable analysis revealed that educational level had significant effects on certain items. Specifically, individuals with A-levels scored lower on F2F15. This indicates, that people whose highest educational level is the A-levels, report to less often check for an authors qualification, before trusting information from that author.
However, individuals with A-levels scored higher on F4F3, indicating, that people whose highest educational level is the A-levels, more often indicate confidence in being able to present data in graphics in a way that they are understandable for different target groups.
Meanwhile higher educational levels were associated with increased scores on F4F8. Indicating, that additionally to people having their A-levels, people holding a degree from a applied university, or a university, show an even greater increase in F4F8. Thus, with higher educational levels, people more often report being able to use programs to create graphics for presenting results.</p>
<p>Age and degree type (e.g., pursuing a master’s degree or state examination) also had significant effects on specific items, though several control variables could not be estimated due to singularity issues.</p>
<p>Everything worked - what do I need to report?
First, report on the three core decisions and how the solution was created, whether it is stable, and how it was validated. The final variant is then reported exactly like a CFA (e.g. Jackson et al., 2009). To have a clear structure, answer the following questions:
How large was the original item pool and how was it created?
What is the structure of the scale?
Which algorithm was used ?
Which objective function was used?
How stable is the final variant?
How was the final variant further validated (e.g. crossvalidate, k-fold)?</p>
<p>The xxx correlations (r = , p ) between the newly created scale and the SWE-IV-16, NFC-K, the general items of the ICT-SC25 and openness and conscientiousness of the BFI-10,respectively, indicate the data literacy scale measures #a similar, yet distinct concept#.</p>

<p>While there is a difference between males and females, with males scoring higher on F1F6, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.308). Therefore, we cannot conclude that gender has a meaningful impact on F1F6. Age does not seem to have a significant effect on F1F6, as the p-values for all age categories are well above 0.05. Education does not appear to have a significant effect on F1F6. The lack of statistical significance across different education categories suggests that education level is not a meaningful predictor for this item. Degree and Occupation do not appear to have a significant effect on F1F6 either, based on the provided p-values and estimates.</p>
<p>Based on the regression results, there is no evidence to support that age is a significant factor influencing the F1F8 scores. The p-values suggest that the effect of age is not meaningful in this context.
The lack of statistical significance (p = 0.667) indicates that gender does not have a meaningful impact on the Likert item F1F8. Although there is a small difference in the scores (males scoring higher), this difference is not statistically significant, suggesting no strong evidence for gender influencing the item.
The education variable does not appear to significantly influence the F1F8 item, with all p-values being greater than 0.05. The education levels may not play a critical role in determining the scores for this particular item.
Both Degree and Occupation do not appear to significantly affect F1F8 either due to issues with missing data or the absence of significant coefficients. The lack of significant p-values and the presence of NA for most categories suggest that these variables have little impact on the Likert item.</p>
<p>The coefficient indicates a small difference in scores between males and females, with males scoring slightly higher. However, the lack of statistical significance (p = 0.6349) means that we cannot confidently say that gender has a meaningful impact on F1F11.
Overall, Age does not appear to have a significant effect on F1F11, as the p-values are all greater than 0.05. This suggests that age does not have a strong or consistent influence on F1F11. Education does not appear to have a significant effect on F1F11, as all the p-values are well above 0.05, suggesting no reliable impact of education on this item.
Degree2 shows indicates that individuals in this category tend to score 3.5 points lower on F1F11. But the p-value is not considered statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05).
Occupation does not show any significant effects on F1F11, with all p-values above 0.05, meaning occupation categories do not have a statistically meaningful relationship with F1F11.</p>
<p>The effect of gender on F1F14 is not statistically significant, as the p-value exceeds the 0.05 threshold.
There is no statistically significant effect of education on F1F14. All education levels show p-values greater than 0.05.
Degree2 does not show a statistically significant effect on F1F14, as the p-value is greater than 0.05.
None of the occupation categories show a statistically significant effect on F1F14, as all p-values are greater than 0.05.</p>
<p>The effect of gender on F2F2 is not statistically significant, as the p-value exceeds the 0.05 threshold.
None of the age categories have a statistically significant effect on F2F2, as all the p-values are greater than 0.05.
There is no statistically significant effect of education on F2F2. All education levels show p-values greater than 0.05.
Degree3 does not show a statistically significant effect on F2F2, as the p-value is greater than 0.05.
None of the occupation categories show a statistically significant effect on F2F2, as all p-values are greater than 0.05.</p>
<p>The effect of gender on F2F6 is not statistically significant, as the p-value exceeds the 0.05 threshold.
None of the age categories have a statistically significant effect on F2F6, as all the p-values are greater than 0.05.
There is no statistically significant effect of education on F2F6, as the p-value is greater than 0.05.
Neither Degree2 nor Degree3 show a statistically significant effect on F2F6, as both p-values are greater than 0.05.
None of the occupation categories show a statistically significant effect on F2F6, as all p-values are greater than 0.05.</p>
<p>The effect of gender on F2F15 is not statistically significant.
No age categories are statistically significant at the 0.05 threshold.
Education5 (Abitur als höchster Bildungsabschluss) is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0303, indicating a negative effect on F2F15.
This indicates, that people whose highest educational level is the “Abitur”, report to less often check for an authors qualification, before trusting informations from that author.
There is no statistically significant effect of degree on F2F15.
None of the occupation categories show statistically significant effects on F2F15.</p>
<p>The effect of gender on F2F20 is not statistically significant.

Education variables do not show statistically significant effects on F2F20.
There is no statistically significant effect of degree on F2F20.
None of the occupation categories show statistically significant effects on F2F20.</p>
<p>No valid statistical results can be derived from this model for F3F2 due to singularities in the data. This suggests that there is perfect collinearity or a lack of variation in the predictor variables.
This indicated that the item F3F2 is problematic and should maybe be exchanged or reformulated.</p>

None of the occupation variables exhibit statistically significant effects on F5F4.</p>
<p>Gender does not have a statistically significant effect on F5F8.
Age22 has a statistically significant negative effect on F5F8.
This indicates that individuals aged 22 experience a decrease of 3.000 points in F5F8 compared to the reference age group.
None of the education variables exhibit statistically significant effects on F5F8.
Degree3 has a significant positive effect on F5F8. Individuals with Degree3 experience a 3.000-point increase in F5F8 compared to the reference degree group.
While Degree3 shows a significant positive association with F5F8, this finding should be interpreted cautiously because the analysis excludes other degree categories due to singularities. Without these categories, the effect of Degree3 might reflect unmeasured contributions from the missing variables.
None of the occupations variables have statistically significant effects.</p>
<p>none of the age variables exhibit statistically significant effects on F5F18.
Gender does not have a statistically significant effect on F5F18.
None of the education variables have a statistically significant effect on F5F18.
Only Degree2 is analyzed due to singularity in the other categories. However, it does not have a statistically significant effect on F5F18.
Degree level does not appear to be a significant predictor of F5F18 in this case.
None of the occupation variables have a statistically significant effect on F5F18. Occupation does not appear to be a reliable predictor of F5F18 in this model, and singularity issues further complicate the interpretation.</p>

<p>The results of this study should be interpreted with several limitations in mind. The sample deviates from the general population in multiple demographic variables, potentially compromising its representativeness and generalizability. Occupational distribution among participants shows clustering in fields such as <em>“Gesundheit, Soziales, Lehre und Erziehung”</em>, <em>“Buchhaltung, Recht und Verwaltung”</em>, <em>“Kaufmännische Dienstleistungen, Vertrieb, Tourismus”</em> and especially <em>“Naturwissenschaft, Geografie und Informatik”</em>. This indicates a selection bias, likely due to recruitment methods (who is reached) and implicitly favoring individuals more interested in data literacy.</p>
<p>The item pool for the questionnaire was specifically trained on this non-representative sample, which may affect its validity. The heterogeneous nature of the construct complicates global instrument development and understanding across all participants. The measure was designed for citizens, potentially limiting discrimination at higher item difficulties or among more literate participants, a direction to be improved in future studies. Also, as data literacy is a heterogeneous construct, the questionnaire could incorporate more aspects to better reflect its full scope, thereby increasing content validity. Expanding the questionnaire with additional items could address this need, although it would deviate from the principle of parsimony.</p>
<p>Additionally, the training and testing data sets differed in size, which could influence measurement invariance testing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chen2007">F. F. Chen, 2007</a>)</span>. While the sample sizes were appropriate, they were at the lower threshold of the prior power analysis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hu1999">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</a>; e.g., <a href="#ref-kass1979">Kass &amp; Tinsley, 1979</a>)</span>, suggesting that larger samples might have been better. Lastly, although the questionnaire showed good model fit, it should be noted that algorithm-based item selection is a heuristic approach, rather than deterministic, and may not always yield the optimal solution<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blum2003">Blum &amp; Roli, 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-schultze2017">Schultze, 2017</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Future research should explore adaptive testing using Item Response Theory (IRT). IRT provides a method to tailor item difficulty to respondents’ ability levels in real-time, enhancing assessment efficiency and precision. This reduces the number of items required while maintaining high measurement accuracy. Implementing IRT is particularly advantageous for heterogeneous constructs like data literacy, as it ensures each participant is evaluated with items suited to their skill level. One of the significant challenges in applying IRT is the assumption of unidimensionality, where items are presumed to measure a single underlying trait. Data literacy, however, is a multi-faceted construct, and future studies should investigate the dimensionality of the scale rigorously.
An alternative to IRT-based adaptive testing is the use of Classification and Regression Trees (CART). CART is a tree-based method that splits data into subsets based on binary decisions, optimizing for predictive accuracy. This approach could simplify adaptive testing by using binary splits to classify respondents into different levels of data literacy. The Gini index can be employed within CART to identify the optimal cutoff points for these splits, ensuring that each branch of the tree maximally distinguishes between different levels of data literacy competence.</p>
