<p>Data Literacy involves the ability to effectively collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data in a critical manner. According to <span class="citation">Wolff et al. (<a href="#ref-wolff2016">2016</a>)</span>, it means being able to ask and answer everyday questions using both small and large datasets while considering ethical aspects. This includes skills such as selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, criticizing, and interpreting data, as well as communicating insights from data and using data for various purposes. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-frank2016">Frank, 2016</a>)</span> distinguish between cognitive skills, like data collection and analysis, and social skills, which involve trusting data while maintaining skepticism. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prado2013">Calzada Prado &amp; Marzal, 2013</a>)</span> outline five dimensions of Data Literacy: understanding data, acquiring data, interpreting and evaluating data, managing data, and using data. Understanding data includes knowing their types, roles, and significance, while acquiring data involves evaluating and selecting sources. Interpreting and evaluating data encompass understanding different presentation methods and data interpretation. Using data involves preparation, analysis, communication, and ethical considerations. Managing data includes storage, management, and reuse.
This highlights one prominent feature of Data Literacy - It is a heterogeneous concept. Every subject or profession seems to hold their own definition or framework of Data Literacy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span>. While that most certainly is good for assessing specific skills (e.g. in an Recruitment test), it limits the generalizability and comparability of Data Literacy across individuals with different background. It furthermore limits the accuracy of communication about the topic as two people with different background might hold different definitions on Data Literacy.
In the study from <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span> it also becomes apparent, that one group seems to be underrepresented in the research on Data Literacy: citizens or the general public.
Although there seem to be several definitions of Data literacy for citizens <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wolff2016">Wolff et al., 2016</a>)</span>, most studies focus on other groups of people. On the first look this appears as a massive oversight, as citizens or the general public is forming the largest group by far, compared to professions like researchers, librarians, students or education provider <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span>. But when taking a closer look into the concept and its comprising factors,it becomes clear that many of those tend to speak to professionals rather than laypeople. In their Framework <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schüller2020">Schüller, 2020</a>)</span> highlight the different roles in Data Literacy: Some of the facets or skills regard data-consumption, whereas the most are skills that data-producers would have.
This is also reflected when taking a look into related concepts.
The definition proposed by <span class="citation">Wolff et al. (<a href="#ref-wolff2016">2016</a>)</span> suggests that data literacy shares some common competencies with statistical and information literacies. Information literacy, often studied in library sciences, overlaps with data literacy in terms of accessing, critically evaluating, and using data sources <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prado2013">Calzada Prado &amp; Marzal, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-shields2005">Shields, 2005</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Wolff et al. (<a href="#ref-wolff2016">2016</a>)</span> also emphasize the importance of the data inquiry process, starting from identifying problems, designing studies, acquiring data, conducting analysis, to drawing data-based conclusions.
In comparison, <span class="citation">Gould (<a href="#ref-gould2017">2017</a>)</span> argued that data literacy is essentially the same as statistical literacy but with additional competencies needed due to the increasing importance of data. These added competencies include understanding who collects the data, how and why data is collected, and understanding data privacy and ownership. However, while statistical literacy focuses on quantitative data and basic statistics, data literacy extends to the ability to understand, access, evaluate, and use arguments and decision-making based on both quantitative and qualitative data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span>.
The framework of <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schüller2020">Schüller, 2020</a>)</span> shows that citizens are mainly covering roles where they consume data/ data products or informations.
Thus, they are most likely to find tasks or items regarding the producing facets like providing or exploiting data more difficult to answer. This would systematically impair the fairness of tests and questionnaires regarding Data Literacy. <span class="citation">Kubinger &amp; Proyer (<a href="#ref-kubinger2005">2005</a>)</span> define fairness as the condition where test measurements or values do not discriminate against specific groups of people who are relevant to the test. In the case of Data Literacy it is to be expected, that the item-difficulties in the producing factors would not be evenly distributed.</p>
<div id="aim-of-the-study" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Aim of the Study<a href="background.html#aim-of-the-study" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We noticed several gaps in the current research that we want to try addressing with this study. For once the target groups for Data Literacy are currently each having their own definition of the construct it seems <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span>. This not only makes comparisons impossible but also makes a general understanding of the topic as well as communication in the community and science communication to the public harder.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-and-information" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Data and Information<a href="background.html#data-and-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>When speaking of Data Literacy, the respective self-perception and how to define and measure both constructs, one naturally has to think about what data is. What is information, how are they different to each other and what extents do they share? And what role does the process of interpretation play? Does one interpret data to make sense of it? And if so, does that mean that data is entropy while information stands in opposition to it?</p>
<p>The concepts of data and information are foundational in various fields, yet their precise definitions and relationships are often subject to interpretation.
According to Shannon’s seminal work on information theory <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-shannon1948">Shannon, 1948</a>)</span>, data can be understood as raw, unprocessed symbols or observations, devoid of inherent meaning. It is through a process of interpretation and organization that data transforms into information, as elucidated by <span class="citation">Bates (<a href="#ref-bates2005">2005</a>)</span>. Bates emphasizes that information emerges when data is structured and presented in a way that is comprehensible and relevant to a particular context or purpose.</p>
<p>Entropy, a concept borrowed from thermodynamics and applied in information theory, plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between data and information. In his landmark paper, <span class="citation">Shannon (<a href="#ref-shannon1948">1948</a>)</span> defines entropy as a measure of uncertainty or disorder in a system. In the realm of information theory, entropy is often associated with the amount of unpredictability or randomness in a set of data.
However, it’s essential to note that entropy can also be viewed as a measure of information content within a system. This perspective is articulated by <span class="citation">Brillouin (<a href="#ref-brillouin1953">1953</a>)</span>, who suggests that low entropy corresponds to a high concentration of meaningful information. Similarly, the work of <span class="citation">Jaynes (<a href="#ref-jaynes1957">1957</a>)</span> highlights the connection between entropy and information, proposing that information can be quantified in terms of the reduction of uncertainty or entropy in a system.
Thus, we can refine our understanding of the relationship between data, entropy, and information. While data serves as the raw material from which information is derived, it’s the reduction of entropy through organization and interpretation that gives rise to meaningful information. Thus, rather than viewing data as synonymous with entropy, it’s more accurate to consider information as emerging from the structured representation of data, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying phenomena.</p>

<p>Statistical literacy, as defined by Gal (2002), encompasses five knowledge dimensions: literacy skills, statistical knowledge, mathematical knowledge, contextual knowledge, and critical reflection skills, along with two dispositional dimensions: beliefs and attitudes, and a critical mindset. It involves understanding written, spoken, or graphical information, knowing why data are needed, grasping basic statistical concepts, understanding probability, and drawing statistical inferences. It also includes basic mathematical operations, interpreting information within a context, and critically questioning the validity of information, particularly in media. Statistical literacy requires a critical attitude and the perception of oneself as competent in statistical reasoning.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.11</span> Information Literacy<a href="background.html#information-literacy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Information literacy is the ability to recognize when information is needed and to effectively locate, evaluate, and use that information (American Library Association (2000). Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education. <a href="http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency" class="uri">http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency</a> ). It empowers individuals to determine the extent of information needed, access it efficiently, critically evaluate information and their sources, incorporate information into their knowledge base, and use it effectively for specific purposes. Additionally, information literacy involves understanding the legal, economic, and social aspects of information use and ensuring ethical and legal access and use of information.
Furthermore, Information literacy is not static; it involves a commitment to lifelong learning and adaptation to evolving information technologies and practices.
This definition already highlights the closeness of Information literacy to Data Literacy.
Another possible way to describe it is suggested by Johnson and Webber (2003):
“Information literacy is the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to obtain,through whatever channel or medium, information well fitted to information needs,together with critical awareness of the importance of wise and ethical use of information in society.” (Johnston &amp; Webber, 2003, p.336)</p>
<p>Also similar to Data Literacy, is its heterogeneous nature. This already becomes apparent when looking at the different frameworks for Information literacy. In the UK, the seven Pillars of IL model was published in 1999 by the SCONUL Advisory Committee on Information Literacy. In 2001, the Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy developed its IL framework, which was revised in 2004 by Bundy. A year later, Mexican standards for IL in higher education were established, influenced significantly by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Standards published in 2000. Work on the Scottish IL framework began in 2004, as documented by Irving in 2011. IL was also a focal point in a European project aimed at revitalizing the European library and information science curriculum, identifying essential topics and teaching methods (Virkus, S., Boekhorst, A.K., Gomez-Hernandez, J.A., Skov, C., &amp; Webber, S. (2005). Information literacy: Conceptions, context and the formation of a discipline.).</p>

<p>Moral Attentiveness <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-reynolds2008">Reynolds, 2008</a>)</span> is a concept that delves into the inherent differences individuals display when it comes to engaging with ethical considerations. Some individuals naturally exhibit a genuine interest and attentiveness to ethical matters, while others may find the subject mundane or remain indifferent, and in extreme cases, appear unresponsive. This inclination toward or against ethics appears to be deeply ingrained, persisting across diverse contexts and proving resistant to various ethics interventions, whether constructive or detrimental.
Importantly, acknowledging one’s interest in ethics does not imply inherent moral virtue or vice, nor does it suggest that behavior is rigid and unchangeable. Rather, it highlights an observation familiar to many practitioners — that certain individuals inherently pay more attention to moral matters. These individuals contribute to making organizational interventions more interactive, enjoyable, and presumably more beneficial compared to those less attuned to such ethical considerations.
Within the field, an implicit assumption is that the variance in individual moral attentiveness can be explained by two existing constructs: moral awareness and moral sensitivity. Moral awareness involves an individual’s recognition that a situation possesses moral implications, while moral sensitivity refers to their capacity to achieve such moral awareness. In essence, the unspoken argument is that an individual’s level of attention to moral matters can be attributed to their moral awareness, moral sensitivity, or a combination of both.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.13</span> Critical Thinking<a href="background.html#critical-thinking" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The conceptualization of Critical Thinking (CrT) has evolved along three main branches: philosophical, psychological, and educational <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rear2019">Rear, 2019</a>)</span>. In the philosophical view, which centers on the mental process of thought, a critical thinker is someone adept at logically evaluating and questioning both the assumptions of others and their own. On the psychological front, which delves into the processes driving action, a critical thinker possesses a combination of skills enabling them to assess a situation and determine the most appropriate course of action. The educational approach aligns more closely with the psychological perspective, relying on frameworks and learning activities tailored to enhance students’ CrT skills and subsequently assess their proficiency in these skills <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-payan2022">Payan Carreira et al., 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The personality trait known as Need for Cognition (NFC) originated in social psychology during the 1940s and 1950s, the concept of NFC, representing an inclination for joyful thinking, is evident in the works of <span class="citation">Maslow (<a href="#ref-maslow1943">1943</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Murphy (<a href="#ref-murphy1947">1947</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Asch (<a href="#ref-asch1952">1952</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Sarnoff &amp; Katz (<a href="#ref-sarnoff1954">1954</a>)</span>. The conceptualization of NFC underwent refinement in the mid-1950s through experimental investigations by Cohen and colleagues <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cohen1955">Cohen et al., 1955</a>)</span>. They defined NFC as “a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways. It is a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cohen1955">Cohen et al., 1955, p. 291</a>)</span>. The concept captures individual variations in the engagement and enjoyment of thinking tasks <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bless1994">Bless et al., 1994</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Core Self-Evaluations (CSE) is a comprehensive personality trait that encompasses fundamental appraisals of one’s worthiness, effectiveness, and capability as a person <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-judge2003">Judge et al., 2003</a>)</span>. This construct, initially introduced by <span class="citation">Judge et al. (<a href="#ref-judge1997">1997</a>)</span>, integrates four traits: self-esteem, emotional stability, generalized self-efficacy, and locus of control, all of which contribute to individuals’ perceptions of themselves and their agency <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-judge2001">Judge &amp; Bono, 2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The study by <span class="citation">Chang et al. (<a href="#ref-chang2012">2012</a>)</span> further emphasizes the role of CSE in individuals’ assessments of their own worthiness and capabilities. These assessments, rooted in self-esteem, emotional stability, generalized self-efficacy, and locus of control, form the core components of CSE <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-judge2003">Judge et al., 2003</a>)</span>. Self-esteem, as established by <span class="citation">Rosenberg (<a href="#ref-rosenberg1965">1965</a>)</span>, provides a foundation for positive self-perceptions, while emotional stability (low neuroticism) characterized by confidence and steadiness <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-goldberg1990">Goldberg, 1990</a>)</span> enhances individuals’ resilience. Generalized self-efficacy, reflecting beliefs about one’s ability to perform across diverse situations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-locke1996">Locke et al., 1996</a>)</span>, and locus of control, which pertains to individuals’ beliefs about the causes of events in their lives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rotter1966">Rotter, 1966</a>)</span>, further shape individuals’ perceptions of their capabilities and control over their environment.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.16</span> Openness towards technology<a href="background.html#openness-towards-technology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The widespread integration of information and communication technology (ICT) in various aspects of daily life, notably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (Richter and Mohr, 2020; Rizun and Strzelecki, 2020), has underscored the significance of individuals’ self-perceived ICT competence. This self-perception extends beyond a general assessment to encompass specific competence domains, referred to as ICT self-concept (ICT-SC). ICT-SC reflects individuals’ mental representations and evaluations of their ICT competences shaped by experiences, feedback, and interactions with the environment.</p>
<p>Research findings indicate that when the objective demands of competence encompass multiple dimensions, the corresponding self-concepts are likewise structured in a multidimensional fashion (Brunner et al., 2010). Examining the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp) and its updated versions, DigComp 2.0/2.1 (Carretero et al., 2017; Vuorikari et al., 2016), reveals a comprehensive structure. This framework not only integrates previous models of ICT competence but also extends its scope, incorporating models such as the Canadian Digital Skill Framework (Chinien and Boutin, 2011) and components of ICT literacy by Katz (2007), among others (e.g., Eshet-Alkalai, 2004; Ferrari, 2012; Martin and Grudziecki, 2006).
Within DigComp and its subsequent versions, ICT competence is systematically organized across five competence domains: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving. These domains encompass a total of 21 competences, providing a comprehensive and nuanced perspective on the multifaceted nature of ICT competence.</p>
