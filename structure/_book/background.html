<p>Data Literacy involves the ability to effectively collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data in a critical manner. According to <span class="citation">Wolff et al. (<a href="#ref-wolff2016">2016</a>)</span>, it means being able to ask and answer everyday questions using both small and large datasets while considering ethical aspects. This includes skills such as selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, criticizing, and interpreting data, as well as communicating insights from data and using data for various purposes. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-frank2016">Frank, 2016</a>)</span> distinguish between cognitive skills, like data collection and analysis, and social skills, which involve trusting data while maintaining skepticism. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prado2013">Calzada Prado &amp; Marzal, 2013</a>)</span> outline five dimensions of Data Literacy: understanding data, acquiring data, interpreting and evaluating data, managing data, and using data. Understanding data includes knowing their types, roles, and significance, while acquiring data involves evaluating and selecting sources. Interpreting and evaluating data encompass understanding different presentation methods and data interpretation. Using data involves preparation, analysis, communication, and ethical considerations. Managing data includes storage, management, and reuse.
This highlights one prominent feature of Data Literacy - It is a heterogeneous concept. Every subject or profession seems to hold their own definition or framework of Data Literacy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span>. While that most certainly is good for assessing specific skills (e.g. in an Recruitment test), it limits the generalisability and comparability of Data Literacy across individuals with different background. It furthermore limits the accuracy of communication about the topic as two people with different background might hold different definitions on Data Literacy. In the study from <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span> it also becomes apparent, that one group seems to be underrepresented in the research on Data Literacy: citizens or the general public.
While there seem to be several definitions of Data literacy for citizens <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wolff2016">Wolff et al., 2016</a>)</span>, most studies focus on other groups of people. This is the case although, the general public is forming the largest group by far, compared to professions like researchers, librarians, students or education provider <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span>. Thus, one might arrive at the question, why that ist? When taking a closer look into the concept and its comprising factors,it becomes clear that many of those factors tend to speak to professionals rather than laypeople. In their Framework <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schüller2020">schüller, 2020</a>)</span> highlight the different roles in Data Literacy: Some of the facets or skills regard “data-consumption”, whereas the most are skills “data-producers” would have.
This is also reflected when taking a look into related concepts. The definition proposed by <span class="citation">Wolff et al. (<a href="#ref-wolff2016">2016</a>)</span> suggests that data literacy shares some common competencies with statistical and information literacies.<br />
Information literacy, often studied in library sciences, overlaps with data literacy in terms of accessing, critically evaluating, and using data sources <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prado2013">Calzada Prado &amp; Marzal, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-shields2005">Shields, 2005</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Wolff et al. (<a href="#ref-wolff2016">2016</a>)</span> also emphasize the importance of the data inquiry process, starting from identifying problems, designing studies, acquiring data, conducting analysis, to drawing data-based conclusions.
In comparison, <span class="citation">Gould (<a href="#ref-gould2017">2017</a>)</span> argued that data literacy is essentially the same as statistical literacy but with additional competencies needed due to the increasing importance of data. These added competencies include understanding who collects the data, how and why data is collected, and understanding data privacy and ownership <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gould2017">Gould, 2017</a>)</span>.
However, while statistical literacy focuses on quantitative data and basic statistics, data literacy extends to the ability to understand, access, evaluate, and use arguments and decision-making based on both quantitative and qualitative data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cui2023">Cui et al., 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="data-and-information" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Data and Information<a href="background.html#data-and-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>With the closeness of those topics, it is worth while to take a look into the terminology, before delving deeper into the topic.
When speaking of Data Literacy, one naturally has to think about what data is. What is information, how are they different to each other and what extents do they share? And what role does the process of interpretation play? Does one interpret data to make sense of it? And if so, does that mean that data is entropy while information stands in opposition to it?
The concepts of data and information are foundational in various fields, yet their precise definitions and relationships are often subject to interpretation. According to Shannon’s seminal work on information theory <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-shannon1948">Shannon, 1948</a>)</span>, data can be understood as raw, unprocessed symbols or observations, devoid of inherent meaning. It is through a process of interpretation and organization that data transforms into information, as elucidated by <span class="citation">Bates (<a href="#ref-bates2005">2005</a>)</span>. Bates emphasizes that information emerges when data is structured and presented in a way that is comprehensible and relevant to a particular context or purpose.</p>
<p>Entropy, a concept borrowed from thermodynamics and applied in information theory, plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between data and information. In his landmark paper, <span class="citation">Shannon (<a href="#ref-shannon1948">1948</a>)</span> defines entropy as a measure of uncertainty or disorder in a system. In the realm of information theory, entropy is often associated with the amount of unpredictability or randomness in a set of data. However, it’s essential to note that entropy can also be viewed as a measure of information content within a system. This perspective is articulated by <span class="citation">Brillouin (<a href="#ref-brillouin1953">1953</a>)</span>, who suggests that low entropy corresponds to a high concentration of meaningful information. Similarly, the work of <span class="citation">Jaynes (<a href="#ref-jaynes1957">1957</a>)</span> highlights the connection between entropy and information, proposing that information can be quantified in terms of the reduction of uncertainty or entropy in a system.
Thus, we can refine our understanding of the relationship between data, entropy, and information. While data serves as the raw material from which information is derived, it’s the reduction of entropy through organization and interpretation that gives rise to meaningful information. Thus, rather than viewing data as synonymous with entropy or information, it’s more accurate to consider information as emerging from the structured representation of data, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying phenomena.</p>
<p>The framework of <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schüller2020">schüller, 2020</a>)</span> shows that citizens are mainly covering roles where they consume data/ data products or informations.
Thus, they are most likely to find tasks or items regarding the producing facets like providing or exploiting data more difficult to answer. This would systematically impair the fairness of tests and questionnaires regarding Data Literacy. <span class="citation">Kubinger &amp; Proyer (<a href="#ref-kubinger2005">2005</a>)</span> define fairness as the condition where test measurements or values do not discriminate against specific groups of people who are relevant to the test. In the case of Data Literacy it is to be expected, that the item-difficulties in the producing factors would not be evenly distributed. As you cant just leave any factors out of the construct, in order to create a concept that is fair, it would be neccessary to find a way to have the same factors in the concept with the same distribution of difficulty for all groups of participants.</p>

<div id="conceptual-integration" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Conceptual Integration<a href="background.html#conceptual-integration" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Thus, via conceptual integration we tried to find common grounds of the existing theories and studies.
By synthesizing heterogeneous definitions and perspectives (as e.g. highlighted in the literature review from <span class="citation">Cui et al. (<a href="#ref-Cui2023">2023</a>)</span>) into cohesive, unified representations and selectively incorporating relevant features while establishing cross-disciplinary connections. With questions in mind like “What factors and facets do most definitions share?”, “What are specifics to certain definitions, addressed to special professions?”, we arrived at the following structure of the concept:<br />
Data literacy is the ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data effectively. It involves asking and answering real-world questions from datasets while considering ethical use. Core skills include selecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, presenting, critiquing, and interpreting data, information and their sources.
We arrived at five core facets that are also very prominent in the most definitions in the literature (Cui et al., 2023). We further divided them into “consumer” facets (Comprehension,Evaluation &amp; Integration), that are relevant for nearly every person in society, from citizens up. And “producer” facets (Communication &amp; Statistics), that are mainly relevant for people, actively working with data.</p>
<div id="comprehension" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">

<p>In line with the framework of <span class="citation">schüller (<a href="#ref-schüller2020">2020</a>)</span> the factors Data Comprehension and Interpretation, Contextualize and Evaluate Data and Data-Informed Worldview are representing the application areas for “consumers”. So they are relevant for all people in scociety, whereas the other factors, those speaking to people who are considered “producers”, are only common for smaller groups of people or certain professions.<br />
This structure encompasses certain characteristics and behaviors from critical thinking, media competency, technology competency, statistical Literacy as well as from information literacy.</p>
<div id="statistical-literacy" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Statistical Literacy<a href="background.html#statistical-literacy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Statistical literacy, as defined by <span class="citation">Gal (<a href="#ref-Gal2002">2002</a>)</span>, encompasses five knowledge dimensions: literacy skills, statistical knowledge, mathematical knowledge, contextual knowledge, and critical reflection skills, along with two dispositional dimensions: beliefs and attitudes, and a critical mindset. It involves understanding written, spoken, or graphical information, knowing why data are needed, grasping basic statistical concepts, understanding probability, and drawing statistical inferences. It also includes basic mathematical operations, interpreting information within a context, and critically questioning the validity of information, particularly in media. Statistical literacy requires a critical attitude and the perception of oneself as competent in statistical reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div id="information-literacy" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Information Literacy<a href="background.html#information-literacy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Information literacy is the ability to recognize when information is needed and to effectively locate, evaluate, and use that information (American Library Association (2000). Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education. <a href="http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency" class="uri">http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency</a> ). It empowers individuals to determine the extent of information needed, access it efficiently, critically evaluate information and their sources, incorporate information into their knowledge base, and use it effectively for specific purposes. Additionally, information literacy involves understanding the legal, economic, and social aspects of information use and ensuring ethical and legal access and use of information.
Furthermore, Information literacy is not static; it involves a commitment to lifelong learning and adaptation to evolving information technologies and practices. This definition already highlights the closeness of Information literacy to Data Literacy.
Another possible way to describe it is suggested by Johnson and Webber (2003):
“Information literacy is the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to obtain,through whatever channel or medium, information well fitted to information needs,together with critical awareness of the importance of wise and ethical use of information in society.” (Johnston &amp; Webber, 2003, p.336)</p>
</div>
<div id="critical-thinking" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Critical Thinking<a href="background.html#critical-thinking" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The conceptualization of Critical Thinking (CrT) has evolved along three main branches: philosophical, psychological, and educational <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rear2019">Rear, 2019</a>)</span>. In the philosophical view, which centers on the mental process of thought, a critical thinker is someone adept at logically evaluating and questioning both the assumptions of others and their own. On the psychological front, which delves into the processes driving action, a critical thinker possesses a combination of skills enabling them to assess a situation and determine the most appropriate course of action. The educational approach aligns more closely with the psychological perspective, relying on frameworks and learning activities tailored to enhance students’ CrT skills and subsequently assess their proficiency in these skills <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-payan2022">Payan Carreira et al., 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Information and Communication Technology Competency<a href="background.html#information-and-communication-technology-competency" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Information and Communication Technology Competency includes general and domain-specific ICT competencies, including communication, processing and storing, content generation, safe application, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Our definition incorporates statistical literacy by emphasizing data interpretation, analysis, and understanding different types of data representations, such as graphs and tables (Data Handling and Analysis). It includes elements of information literacy by focusing on evaluating the credibility of data sources, considering factors like reputation and biases, which are similar to assessing the quality of information sources (Contextualize and Evaluate Data).
Both statistical and information literacy involve using data and information to make informed decisions. Data literacy emphasizes integrating data-driven insights into ones opinions and values, that then later on influence decision-making processes, aligning with the goals of statistical and information literacy. The factor “Data Comprehension and Interpretation” encompasses behaviors and skills associated with critical thinking, such as the capacity to identify weaknesses in one’s reasoning or to actively shape discourse and, consequently, the public dissemination of information. The factor “Contextualize and Evaluate Data”, as well as the “Statistics” factor, encompass behaviors and skills related to technology competency. This includes abilities such as navigating and critically evaluating online sources and platforms, using information and communication technology, as well as utilizing statistical software, among others. The “consumer” factors are also closely related to media literacy, which focuses on skills related to critically analyzing and interpreting various media formats, including text, images, and videos, for understanding and engaging with media content.</p>
<p>In contrast, statistical literacy often focuses more narrowly on statistical concepts and methods, such as probability, sampling, and hypothesis testing. This definition encompasses a broader range of skills beyond statistical concepts, such as data visualization, software usage, and understanding data collection methods. While statistical literacy often involves analyzing existing data, this definition also encompasses skills related to producing and manipulating data. This includes tasks such as creating visualizations and using software tools. This aspect goes beyond traditional statistical literacy and aligns more closely with data literacy. While information literacy involves assessing the quality of information sources, this definition places a particular emphasis on assessing data quality, considering factors like sample size, biases, and data context. This aspect extends beyond traditional information literacy and is more specific to data literacy. To contrast data literacy from technology competency, it is to be highlighted, that data literacy involves proficiency in using technology, but thereby focuses specifically on understanding and working with data. Technology competency encompasses a broader set of digital skills that extend beyond those relevant for data literacy.</p>

<p>The personality trait known as Need for Cognition (NFC) originated in social psychology during the 1940s and 1950s, the concept of NFC, representing an inclination for joyful thinking, is evident in the works of <span class="citation">Maslow (<a href="#ref-maslow1943">1943</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Murphy (<a href="#ref-murphy1947">1947</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Asch (<a href="#ref-asch1952">1952</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Sarnoff &amp; Katz (<a href="#ref-sarnoff1954">1954</a>)</span>. The conceptualization of NFC underwent refinement in the mid-1950s through experimental investigations by Cohen and colleagues <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cohen1955">Cohen et al., 1955</a>)</span>. They defined NFC as “a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways. It is a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cohen1955">Cohen et al., 1955, p. 291</a>)</span>. The concept captures individual variations in the engagement and enjoyment of thinking tasks <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bless1994">Bless et al., 1994</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Our goal was to derive a holistic definition of data literacy based on existing approaches and to develop a questionnaire for self-perceived data literacy, measuring the three core factors of the construct (First drafts of items for two additional factors were included as preliminary assessments for future studies, but were not the goal of this study).</p>
