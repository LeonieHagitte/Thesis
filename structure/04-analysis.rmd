# Analysis

Algorithm-based item selection is used to choose the most relevant items, reducing the item pool. Unlike classical approaches that consider items based on their individual merits, heuristic item selection algorithms aim to enhance the psychometric properties of a set of items within predetermined constraints (Schultze, 2017). The sample is split into training and test datasets to evaluate solutions against an objective function consisting of model fit criteria and composite reliability. In automated item selection, items can be chosen as sets that meet specific criteria. Those criteria will be defined in the objective function in ‘stuart’ (Schultze, 2020). I want to optimize the final model for model-fit and reliability (RMSEA, SRMR, CFI & McDonald's $\omega$ ) as well as variability in the difficulty of items.

Relationships between the newly created measure and related constructs are hypothesised. Construct validity is evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using MLR as estimator. and correlation analyses with related constructs. Crossvalidation and measurement invariance tests are also conducted.
I expect the final questionnaire to correlate moderately up to highly positive with the SWE-IV-16 (Behm, 2018), measuring peoples ability to engage in information behaviour. I expect a moderate, positive correlation of the final scale with the five general items of the ICT-SC25 (Schauffel et al., 2021). I expect a small positive correlation with the NFC-K (Beißert et al., 2015), assessing the Need for Cognition (NFC). I also expect small positive correlations with openness and conscientiousness of the BFI-10 (Rammstedt et al., 2014). 
The provided sample will be divided into subsets using the ‘holdout' function in ‘stuart’. The specified item-selection procedure will be then applied to the training dataset first. It will then be tested on the testing dataset. 
Validation will be conducted using the ‘crossvalidate’ and/or the ‘kfold’ function in ‘stuart’ to assess the invariance of the measurement models between the training and validation datasets. Invariance levels will be measured with  the ‘max.invariance' function. Invariance will be necessary to claim that the scale validation has worked.  
The final item selection will be determined by the highest value on the objective function in the multiple-group SEM, while ensuring 'max.invariance' between the training and validation data, as well as in a possible k-fold crossvalidation.
