# Results
The descriptive analysis of the selected items showed several results to be highlighted. The item *F1F11* ("Ich kenne unterschiedliche Arten von Grafiken") had a high average score (M = 4.48, SD = 0.75), indicating that respondents rated their knowledge of different types of graphs very positively. Similarly, *F3F9* ("Ich kann neue Informationen in meinen Wissensstand integrieren") also demonstrated a strong ceiling effect with a mean of 4.32 (SD = 0.64), suggesting that integrating new information is a skill, respondents deemed well-developed.
Furthermore, several items exhibited high variability in responses. The item *F4F1* ("Ich kann Ergebnisse in Streudiagrammen darstellen") had the lowest mean (M = 2.88) but also the highest standard deviation (SD = 1.45), indicating substantial differences in respondents’ perceived abilities to use scatterplots, or in their understanding of the item. Other items with notable variability included *F4F3* ("Ich kann Daten in Grafiken so präsentieren, dass sie für verschiedene Zielgruppen verständlich sind," M = 3.45, SD = 1.23), *F5F3* ("Ich bin in der Lage, einfache Datenbanken zu verwalten," M = 3.44, SD = 1.31), and *F5F4* ("Ich kann Datensätze mit einfachen statistischen Methoden analysieren," M = 3.28, SD = 1.26), reflecting diverse self-assessments of these specific skills.
Additionally, item *F2F2* ("Wenn Ich die Glaubwürdigkeit von Informationen beurteile, berücksichtige ich den Ruf der Quelle"), had a relatively high average (M = 4.04) as well as variability (SD = 1.04), suggesting differing abilities to evaluate source credibility. Similarly, *F2F6* ("Ich kenne Merkmale zur Bewertung von Datenqualität," M = 3.19, SD = 1.13) and *F5F18* ("Wenn ich Daten analysiere, achte ich auf ein systematisches Vorgehen," M = 3.74, SD = 1.13) showed considerable variation, highlighting mixed levels of competency in assessing data quality and conducting systematic analyses. Table 1 presents the translation of the final set of items along with their means and standard deviations. The original German versions of the items are available in the supplementary material.

## Model Fit and Measurement Invariance
Of all explored conditions and respective models, the following model is to be highlighted, as it showed the best overall fit.
With an objective function only optimizing for model fit criteria (RMSEA, SRMR, CFI), the algorithm selected 20 of the 71 original items representing the five factors Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication and Statistics with four items each (Figure 3). The solution exhibits good model fit [according to @hu1999] with data treated as metric and MLR as estimator: Satorra-Bentler-$X^{2}$ (df = 414, N = 373) = 582.582, p < 0.001, CFI = .96, TLI = .96, SRMR = .08, RMSEA = .05, 90%-CIRMSEA [.036; .054]. Those fit indices indicate a good model fit, according to @hu1999.

knitr::include_graphics("images/Model5.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
For the configural model of the training sample in the MGCFA, standardized loadings of the factor Comprehension ranged from .58 to .77. For the factor Evaluation loadings ranged from .35 to .74. For the factor Integration loadings ranged from .46 to .78. For the factor Communication loadings ranged from .56 to .75. For the factor Statistics loadings ranged from .60 to .74. The complete model is also displayed in Figure 3.

```{r figure4, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Measurement Model of the configural MGCFA Model in the test sample .", out.width="\\textwidth", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Model6.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
For the configural model of the test sample in the MGCFA, standardized loadings of the factor Comprehension ranged from .63 to .73. For the factor Evaluation loadings ranged from .29 to .89. For the factor Integration loadings ranged from .32 to .77. For the factor Communication loadings ranged from .56 to .77. For the factor Statistics loadings ranged from .70 to .81. The complete model is also displayed in Figure 4.
Cross-validation of the MG-CFA with the test-data indicated that the assumption of scalar invariance holds across the two subsamples: $X^{2}$(df = 389, N = 373) = 659.746, p < 0.001, CFI = .92, SRMR = .087, RMSEA = .038; $\Delta\text{CFI}$ = .00 , $\Delta\text{SRMR}$ = .00, $\Delta\text{RMSEA}$ = .001 (cf. Table 2)

\end{table}

The model of the final set of items shows McDonald’s $\omega$ total = .92. The composite values McDonald’s $\omega$ total of the factors are Comprehension = .76, Evaluation = .65, Integration = .67, Communication = .81 and  Statistics = .68. 
While overall fit indices (e.g., RMSEA, CFI) suggest a good fit, an analysis of correlated residual was done to reveal possible specification errors.
The correlated residuals from the training sample can be seen in the supporting material. The correlated residuals from the testing sample can be seen in the supporting material. Both samples show several residuals to be correlated.

## Multicollinearity 
To furthermore investigate the model, the covariances of the latent factors were examined. The factor correlations for the training sample are displayed in Table 2. The correlation of .97 between *Communication* and *Statistics* is to be highlighted. The correlations for the test sample in Table 3. In the test sample the correlation of .84 between *Communication* and *Statistics* is to be highlighted as well, alongside the correlation of .92 between *Comprehension* and *Integration*, as well as the correlation of .87 between *Evaluation* and *Integration*. Especially the correlations, that exceed .90 suggest multicollinearity in the data.

## Criterion Validity  
For the latent correlations, Kendall's rank correlation coefficient - Kendalls tau was estimated, because the data was not normally distributed. The factors (Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication & Statistics) of the data literacy scale correlated moderately to highly with the SWE-IV-16 ( $\tau$ =.47, $\tau$ =.46, $\tau$ =.40, $\tau$ =.48, $\tau$ =.39 ; all p < .01). The factors of data literacy showed small to moderate correlations with the NFC-K ($\tau$ =.22, $\tau$ =.24, $\tau$ =.30, $\tau$ =.37, $\tau$ =.42; all p < .01). The factors of the data literacy scale showed moderate correlations with the general items of the ICT-SC25 ($\tau$ =.31, $\tau$ =.17, $\tau$ =.23, $\tau$ =.43, $\tau$ =.32; all p < .01). The factors Comprehension, Evaluation and Integration correlated slightly negative with the openness of the BFI-10($\tau$ = -.15, p < .05; $\tau$ = -.18, p < .01; $\tau$ = -.26, p < .01). Openness did not correlate statistically significant with the other factors. The factors Comprehension, Evaluation, Communication and Statistics correlated slightly up tp moderate with conscientiousness of the BFI-10($\tau$ = .13, p < .05; $\tau$ = .25, p < .01; $\tau$ = .16, p < .05; $\tau$ = .17, p < .01). The latent correlations with respective confidence intervals are also displayed in Table X in the supporting materials.

## Control Variables  
The analysis of control variables (gender, educational level, aspired degree, and occupation classification) revealed that most items showed no statistically significant effects. Singularity issues, particularly in degree and occupation categories, further limited the interpretability of some results.  
For 'Education 5' (A-levels), a significant negative effect was found on F2F15 (b = -3.00, p = 0.03), indicating an average score 3.00 points lower than individuals with higher educational levels. Conversely, A-levels had a positive effect on F4F3 (b = 3.91, p = 0.04). Education also influenced F4F8, where A-levels (b = 2.82, p = 0.02), 'Education 7' (degree from a university of applied sciences) (b = 7.46, p = 0.00), and 'Education 8' (university degree) (b = 7.04, p = 0.00) also showed significant positive effects.  
For the Degree variable, 'Degree 2' (Masters) showed a significant negative effect on F4F8 ($b$ = -3.20, $p$ = 0.05), while 'Degree 3' (state examination) had a positive effect ($b$ = 2.60, $p$ = 0.03). On F5F8, pursuing a state examination showed a positive effect ($b$ = 3.00, $p$ = 0.05), while pursuing a Master and 'Degree 4' (doctorate) encountered singularity issues and could not be estimated.  
Finally, for 'Age 22', a significant negative effect was found on F5F8 ($b$ = -3.00, $p$ < 0.05), indicating individuals aged 22 scored, on average, 3.00 points lower than the reference groups.
