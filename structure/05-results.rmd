## Model Fit and Measurement Invariance
Of all explored conditions and respective models, the following model is to be highlighted. An overview over all models and their model fit can be found in the supplementary material.
With an objective function, only optimizing for model fit criteria (RMSEA, SRMR, CFI), the algorithm selected 20 of the 71 original items representing the five factors Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication and Statistics with four items each (Figure X). The solution exhibits good model fit [according to @hu1999] with data treated as metric and ML as estimator: Satorra-Bentler-$X^{2}$ (df = 414, N = 373) = 582.582, p < 0.001, CFI = .96, TLI = .96, SRMR = .08, RMSEA = .05, 90%-CIRMSEA [.036; .054]. 
Standardized loadings of the factor Comprehension ranged from .09 to .65. For the factor Evaluation loadings ranged from .44 to .64. For the factor Integration loadings ranged from .35 to .72. For the factor Communication loadings ranged from .75 to .82. For the factor Statistics loadings ranged from .41 to .68. The complete model is also displayed in figure X.
All factor loadings including standard errors can be found in the Supplementary Material. 
Cross-validation of the MG-CFA with the test-data indicated that the assumption of scalar invariance holds across the two subsamples: $X^{2}$(df = 389, N = 373) = 659.746, p < 0.001, CFI = .92, SRMR = .087, RMSEA = .038; $\Delta\text{CFI}$ = .00 , $\Delta\text{SRMR}$ = .00, $\Delta\text{RMSEA}$ = .001.

## Latent Correlations 
To furthermore investigate the model, the covariances of the latent factors were examined. The factor correlations for the training sample are displayed in table X. The correlation of .97 between *Communication* and *Statistics* is to be highlighted. The correlations for the test sample in table X. In the test sample the correlation of .84 between *Communication* and *Statistics* is to be highlighted as well, alongside the correlation of .92 between *Comprehension* and *Integration*, as well as the correlation of .87 between *Evaluation* and *Integration*. 

For the latent correlations, Kendall's rank correlation coefficient - Kendalls tau was estimated, because the data was not normally distributed. The factors (Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication & Statistics) of the data literacy scale correlated moderately to highly with the SWE-IV-16 ( $\tau$ =.47, $\tau$ =.46, $\tau$ =.40, $\tau$ =.48, $\tau$ =.39 ; all p < .01). The factors of data literacy showed small to moderate correlations with the NFC-K ($\tau$ =.22, $\tau$ =.24, $\tau$ =.30, $\tau$ =.37, $\tau$ =.42; all p < .01). The factors of the data literacy scale showed moderate correlations with the general items of the ICT-SC25 ($\tau$ =.31, $\tau$ =.17, $\tau$ =.23, $\tau$ =.43, $\tau$ =.32; all p < .01). The factors Comprehension, Evaluation and Integration correlated slightly negative with the openness of the BFI-10($\tau$ = -.15, p < .05; $\tau$ = -.18, p < .01; $\tau$ = -.26, p < .01). Openness did not correlate statistically significant with the other factors. The factors Comprehension, Evaluation, Communication and Statistics correlated slightly up tp moderate with conscientiousness of the BFI-10($\tau$ = .13, p < .05; $\tau$ = .25, p < .01; $\tau$ = .16, p < .05; $\tau$ = .17, p < .01). The latent correlations with respective confidence intervals are also displayed in table 3.

## Reliability
The model of the final set of items shows McDonald’s $\omega$ total = .92. The composite values McDonald’s $\omega$ total of the factors are Comprehension = .85, Evaluation = .70, Integration = .65, Communication = .68 and  Statistics = .56.
