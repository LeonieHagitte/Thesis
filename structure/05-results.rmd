## Model Fit and Latent Structure in the Construction Sample
### Model 1
The Algorithm selected 20 of the 71 original items representing the five factors Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication and Statistics with four items each (Figure X). The final solution exhibits acceptable model fit [according to the combinational rule of @hu1999] with MLR as estimator: Satorra-Bentler-$X^{2}$ (df = 375, N = 373) = 637.99, p < 0.001, CFI = .88, TLI = .87, SRMR = .07, RMSEA = .06, 90%-CIRMSEA [.053; .069]. 
Standardized loadings of the factor Comprehension ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Evaluation loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Integration loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Communication loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Statistics loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX.
All factor loadings including standard errors can be found in the Supplementary Material.

Standardized loadings of the factor Comprehension ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Evaluation loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Integration loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Communication loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Statistics loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX.

### Model 3
The Algorithm selected 20 of the 71 original items representing the five factors Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication and Statistics with four items each (Figure X). The final solution exhibits acceptable model fit [according to the combinational rule of @hu1999] with ordered data and WLSMV as estimator: Satorra-Bentler-$X^{2}$ (df = 375, N = 373) = 493.896, p = 0.003, CFI = .99, TLI = .97, SRMR = .07, RMSEA = .03, 90%-CIRMSEA [.026; .047]. 
Standardized loadings of the factor Comprehension ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Evaluation loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Integration loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Communication loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX. For the factor Statistics loadings ranged from 0.XX to 0.XX.
All factor loadings including standard errors can be found in the Supplementary Material. 

## Model Fit and Latent Structure in the Validation Sample
Cross-validation of the MG-CFA with the test-data indicated that the assumption of XXXX measurement invariance holds across the two subsamples: $X^{2}$(XXX) = XXX, p < XXX, CFI = 0.XXX, SRMR = 0.XXX, RMSEA = 0.XXX; $X^{2}$ = XXX, df = XX, p = 0.XXXX. 

## Reliability and Sensitivity Analysis
The model of the final set of items shows McDonald’s $\omega$ total = .92. The composite values McDonald’s $\omega$ total of the factors are Comprehension = .85, Evaluation = .70, Integration = .65, Communication = .68 and  Statistics = .56. 

## Latent Correlations 
The factors (Comprehension, Evaluation, Integration, Communication & Statistics) of the data literacy scale correlated moderately to highly with the SWE-IV-16(r =.47, r =.45, r =.42, r =.48, r =.42 ; p < .01). The factors Comprehension, Communication and Statistics showed small correlations with the NFC-K(r =.09, p < .05; r =.16, p < .01; r =.16, p < .01). The other factors showed no statistically significant correlations. The factors of the data literacy scale showed moderate correlations with the general items of the ICT-SC25(r =.32, r =.21, r =.22, r =.38, r =.30 , p < .01). The factor Evaluation correlated slightly negative with the openness of the BFI-10(r = -.10, p < .05). Openness did not correlate statistically significant with the other factors. The factors of the data literacy scale correlated slightly positive with conscientiousness of the BFI-10(r = .22, p < .01; r = .13, p < .01; r = .15, p < .01; r = .16, p < .01; r = .18, p < .01). The latent correlations are also displayed in table 3.
